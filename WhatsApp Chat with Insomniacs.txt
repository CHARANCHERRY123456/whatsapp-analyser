01/02/2024, 22:26 - Rafiq Room Mate: Let me give you very basic and useful formula for any amount of salary in India.

Whenever you want to calculate in hand salary just get 75% of CTC. *That will give you very close amount of in hand salary.*

I have assumption that you are using all available exemptions.

24*.75 = 18 LPA

CTC √ó .75 = in hand salary.

I hope this well help most IT employees who mostly confused in this calculation. <This message was edited>

Greetings of the Day!!!

It was observed that many students have not reported to the campus and, hence, have not attended the classes of Sem-II, even though the commencement date is from 19th Jan 2024. All students are hereby strictly informed to attend the classes regularly to maintain the required attendance. As you all know, 75% attendance in each subject is mandatory to be eligible to write the EST as per the academic guidelines. Therefore, be cautious of this attendance requirement.

Academic Calendar is attached for your information.

07/03/2024, 08:43 - Rafiq Room Mate: Hello everyone,

Many of our friends are sharing their online course completion certificates on LinkedIn. This can enhance the appearance of our LinkedIn profiles. However, I want to point out that there are different types of certificates, such as the Certificate of Participation (provided to everyone who attended the course), Certificate of Excellence/Appreciation (awarded to a limited number of people who have made significant contributions to the course), and Certificate of Recognition (given to those with exceptional talent). These are some of the certificate types. Among these, try not to post or share Certificates of Participation, as they do not add value to your profile and categorize you as just like everyone else.
07/03/2024, 08:43 - Rafiq Room Mate: Avoid unpaid internships. If you choose to pursue one, opt for companies or startups that are widely recognized or have a solid reputation. Based on what I know, I advise against internships at companies like InternPe, SKILLINTRO, LearnNex, TeachNook, etc. If you do Internship in them, focus on learning rather than sharing the experience on LinkedIn. Initially, strive to acquire practical knowledge through platforms like YouTube and Coursera, etc. Once you‚Äôve gained practical skills, look for internships on LinkedIn, Monster, Naukri, and similar sites.

Refrain from joining WhatsApp groups such as Teachnook and LearnNex; they are unproductive.

Most importantly, only share information with your friends or classmates if you believe it will add value for them; otherwise, refrain from sharing.

23/03/2024, 07:57 - SKY: I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to bring your attention to an important matter regarding your health and well-being.

Recently, there has been growing concern about the consumption of energy drinks, particularly among young adults like yourselves. One such beverage, Sting Energy Drink, has gained popularity, but its effects on health are not without risks.

While energy drinks may seem like a quick fix for fatigue or a boost in energy, they often contain high levels of caffeine and sugar, which can have adverse effects on your health, especially when consumed in excess.

Specifically, Sting Energy Drink contains ingredients that can be harmful to your health. These include:

Caffeine: Sting Energy Drink contains high levels of caffeine, which can lead to caffeine dependency, increased heart rate, anxiety, and insomnia. Excessive caffeine consumption can also cause heart palpitations and may exacerbate underlying heart conditions.

Sugar: Like many other energy drinks, Sting contains significant amounts of sugar. Consuming too much sugar can contribute to weight gain, tooth decay, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Artificial Sweeteners: Some energy drinks, including Sting, may also contain artificial sweeteners like aspartame or sucralose. These sweeteners have been linked to potential health risks, including digestive issues and adverse effects on gut bacteria.

As students, it's crucial to prioritize your health and make informed choices about what you consume. Instead of relying on energy drinks, I encourage you to explore healthier alternatives to boost your energy levels, such as staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, eating balanced meals, and engaging in regular physical activity.

Additionally, I urge you to educate yourselves about the potential risks associated with energy drink consumption and share this information with your peers.

Your health and well-being are important, and we're here to support you in any way we can.

14/04/2024, 23:31 - Rafiq Room Mate: Once Rohit was playing at 75(44) then scored 25 runs in 17 balls just to complete his hundred. But but Virat Kohli is selfish ü§£
14/04/2024, 23:34 - Rafiq Room Mate: 73(42) to 86*(55)

That is basically 13(13) when MI needed 16 an over. No I am not hating Rohit Sharma here but imagine the analysis that would have took place if Kohli was the one who was batting. They could have called him selfish and what not

Exact 8 days back his fans were writing paras on how anyone who doesn't score a century despite playing 60 balls is a statpadder. He's 96(60) right now, 19 runs in his last 20 balls..

As he enters the room, he accidentally drops a perfume bottle, and his mom says, "Shit!" "Mom, what is shit?" and she says, "Perfume." So he goes to see his dad (who is carving a chicken), and his dad cuts himself and yells, "Fuck!" The boy asks, "Dad, what does fuck mean?" and dad says "preparing." Then he follows his dad upstairs. A few minutes later his mom and dad are about to have sex when his dad says, "Where are the condoms?" The little boy asks, "What are condoms?" and his father says, "Condoms are coats and jackets." The following night his father invites over some important business clients. The boy opens the door for them and says, "Hello! Please come in, Bastards and bitches. Hang your condoms up here, my mom is upstairs rubbing shit on her face and my dad is downstairs fucking the chicken.

25/05/2024, 09:45 - Rafiq Room Mate: No Wonder India hasn't win a single trophy since 2013. MS Dhoni used to take tough calls.... after winning WC 2011, MS Dhoni dropped Sehwag, Sachin, Zaheer, Bhajji, Yuvraj and others and won Champions Trophy 2013 by backing young guns.

But Rohit Sharma despite failing in T2OI WCs is still part of Indian Cricket System.
25/05/2024, 09:55 - Rafiq Room Mate: Rohit being part of BCCI is because they sacked Kohli who was good for Rohit. If they sack Rohit without a trophy they will be announcing themselves as jokers(which they are) to the whole world.

Sadly they will have to stick with Rohit & he's making the most out of it.

Yesterday he had lost IPL final.

And then there is some captain who is known as Selfless claiming that he plays for team not for milestones, who had no performance in single T20 WC and IPL, and he will be captaining the team when his spot as a player is a loss to the team. <This message was edited>

"One man can't win you the tournament, it's the team that wins you "
29/05/2024, 10:36 - Rafiq Room Mate: "What was their own performance like when they were the captain? I don't think, be it Kevin Pietersen or AB de Villiers, they had any performance in their career with leadership. Nothing. If you pick and see their records, I think they are worse than any other leader. I don't think *AB de Villiers has achieved anything in the IPL apart from his own scores*."

If he can't win IPL then what can he do with it,  it's a team which wins you tournaments <This message was edited>
29/05/2024, 10:38 - Rafiq Room Mate: "I don't think he has achieved anything from a team's point of view, *Hardik Pandya is still an IPL-winning captain*. So you should only compare oranges to oranges. Not apple to oranges," Gambhir had said.

Hardik Pandya has not won the trophy single handedly, it's because of his team.

He never credited Ms Dhoni as a world cup winning captain.

27/06/2024, 06:55 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Kalki2898AD is a larger than life Sci-FI Action Experience. The visuals and world building by Nag Ashwin are never before from Indian Cinema. However, Nag Ashwin shows some inexperience in building a proper drama and emotional connect with somewhat of a flat screenplay. 

Still, he was able to manage a couple of very good blocks especially the climax which worked very well and is goosebumps worthy. 

Despite some of its flaws, This is a movie that should be experienced on the big screen for the experience it offers!

02/08/2024, 09:27 - Rafiq Room Mate: Dear Students,

It has been observed that few students are causing disturbance in the hostels during late hours of the day. This is disrupting harmony and peace at the hostels.

It has been observed that students are playing online games in groups and making loud noises. Few other students are playing physical games and damaging college properties.

This types of acts are not at all tolerable. If any student(s) are found indulging in such type of acts will attract strict punishment and repeated offenders will be expelled from the hostel.

We expect all the residents of the hostel to go to sleep by 10:30PM and get wake by 5:30AM. This will help to maintain the circadian rytham and will also boost your effectiveness and efficiency to accomplish the tasks you are intended to achieve.

Finally I conclude that from now on hostels will be closely monitored round the clock.

Consider this mail as a cautionary mail and restraint yourself from involving in late night distributing acts.

Regards,

Imram Shareef.

15/08/2024, 09:32 - Rafiq Room Mate: #DoubleISMART Follows a very similar template to the prequel. Ram‚Äôs energy is the mainstay of the film and makes it bearable. However, the routine taking of Puri and the artificial drama like narration tests your patience. Ali‚Äôs comedy track is so cringe that it makes us laugh at how stupid it is. Ram and few intriguing sequences stand out. If you liked the prequel, then this one may appeal to you. If not, it is an avoidable fare that offers nothing appealing.

15/08/2024, 11:50 - Rafiq Room Mate: #MrBachchan is an outdated commercial entertainer that totally deviates from the core soul of #Raid and tries to fill it with commercial elements that do not work at all. The entertainment quotient only works in few places and tests your patience for the most part. It seems like the directors main goal was to highlight the herione Bhagyashri Borse which he did well. The songs stand out. The rest is skippable!

Secrets Behind The Mysterious Disappearance of Sukanya Devi & Her Family 

Sukanya Devi, aged 24 years, is a resident of Amethi. She is the daughter of Balram Singh and Sumitra Devi. Sukanya used to consider Rahul Gandhi as her ideal.

She has been waiting for an opportunity to meet Rahul for the last 2 years. Balram Singh has been a loyal Congress worker since Indira's time.

Amethi is considered a stronghold of the Congress since the era of Indira & Nehru. 

It was during those days that Sonia Maino put Rahul Gandhi in the field of Indian politics.

On 3rd December 2006, Rahul Gandhi was camping at Amethi along with 6 others. Out of the 7, 3 of them were British, 2 Italians, and 1 unknown youth.

It is December 3, 2006. At that time it was 9 o'clock at night. And it was getting very cold.

Around 9 P.M., all of them were drinking liquor at a V.I.P. guest house in a high-security zone.

Sukanya Devi, who was waiting to meet Rahul Gandhi for 2 years, went to the guest house to meet Rahul.

But the security officer there allowed only one person to go inside, so Sukanya went to Rahul alone.

Inside the room were Rahul Gandhi, three more British, two Italians, and an unknown youth. Media reports also state that Rahul Gandhi was drinking alcohol.

Rahul Gandhi proposed to Sukanya to drink alcohol while making fun of her. Sukanya was amazed to see all this, and she was feeling uncomfortable. She refused to have liquor and took permission to leave, but she was forced to stay back and drink.

She kept resisting, but they raped her one by one. She cried for help, but her cries fell on deaf ears. Even the security personnel preferred to remain as mute spectators.

She kept weeping all along. It is also said that Sukanya was given Rs 50,000 to keep quiet.

Along with this, Rahul Gandhi also threatened that Sukanya's entire family would be killed if she told anyone about the incident of rape. Saying this, Sukanya was thrown out of the guest house.

27/09/2024, 06:26 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Devara A Passable Action Drama with a Good 1st Half but a 2nd half that was dragged in parts till the pre-climax. 

Koratala showed a lot of promise in his writing in the 1st half and setup the story well. However, the 2nd half should‚Äôve been racier and became too predictable after a point. 

NTR gave a terrific performance and has carried this one on his shoulders. Anirudh is the lifeline of the movie and has done very well in terms of music. 

Film has some super blocks but at the same time blocks that had below par execution. Ends up as a Satisfactory Watch that can be given a try!

A girl in my village had a boyfriend when she studied in the city.

They canceled the wedding.

I don‚Äôt know what Shastri has achieved in his career apart from winning the World Championship in Australia. I don‚Äôt think he was a part of an overseas series win. If you haven‚Äôt won anything yourself, you end up giving this kind of statement. I‚Äôm sure people wouldn‚Äôt have taken this seriously. I‚Äôm sure he must not have seen enough cricket. If he had he seen enough cricket, he wouldn‚Äôt have given that statement,‚Äù said Gambhir in an old interview with News 18

03/11/2024, 20:13 - Rafiq Room Mate: BCCI's 12 year run of winning 18 consecutive test series began with Dhoni sacking an insecure and overrated Gambhir.

Their run ended when Shah and Rohit brought this virus back into their team.

Thank You MS Dhoni! Greatest captain of all time üêê

14/11/2024, 10:24 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Kanguva is a below par fantasy action film that had a story with good potential but is executed in a clumsy way. 

Surya does well in his role and his efforts should be appreciated but it‚Äôs hard to save a script like this with just a performance. 

The film has a few decent blocks here and there but the rest in between is very flat. The emotional connectivity needed for a film like this is completely missing. Director Siva holds the screenplay together partially in the first half but loses it in the second which makes it hard to sit through after a point. BGM works in few places but is too loud and not impactful in others. Production values are good. 

Not up to the mark!

20/11/2024, 10:09 - Rafiq Room Mate: Dear all,
               To streamline the outpass issues, the administration of RK Valley has conducted a meeting, and the following points were finalized:
1) An out-pass is needed if the student leaves the campus for his personal work. 
2) A student will be given a maximum of 6 out passes till the end of semester II of the AY 2024-25. Hence, the students are informed to utilize the out passes wisely.
3) An out pass is NOT required during Dasara, Pongal, and summer vacation. 
4) The student need not utilize his/her outpass if he/she goes on college-related activities like sports/NSS etc. In case of sports or other college-related activities, the student must bring a letter from the concerned HoD (Physical education dept/NSS program officer, etc) duly mentioning the purpose of leaving the campus. The letter needs to be signed by the warden concerned, and then the students will be permitted to leave the campus.     
4) Students are NOT permitted into and out of the campus after 9.30 PM.
5) Students must stay in their respective hostels on or before 8.30 PM unless they have taken an out-pass and returned to the hostels. 
6) If students attend night study hours, they should stay in the classrooms until the completion of study hour and return to hostels immediately after the study hour.   
7) If a student wants to go to Vempalli and other nearby places, then the student will be permitted out of the campus after working hours of college (after 4.30 PM). The student has to come back on or before 9.30 PM. However, students will be permitted out of the campus from 7 AM to 9.30 PM during holidays.  
 
Thanks and Regards,

05/12/2024, 06:52 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Pushpa2‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ is a Decently Packaged Commercial Entertainer with a Good 1st Half and a 2nd Half that started well but drops pace significantly in the last hour. 

The first half starts right where Part 1 ends. This half runs purely on drama which feels slightly slow at times but Pushpa‚Äôs characterization and the dialogues run the show. 

The second half starts well and the Jathara sequence came out superbly but after this sequence, the film dips drastically in the last hour with no aim and gets dragged out till the end. 

Allu Arjun is absolutely terrific again in this and proves once again why he is one of the most talented actors across India. He deserves all the praise.

The length and the last hour are the biggest drawbacks for the film and a better climax would‚Äôve made a big difference. 

The film may not have reached the full expectations, but it ends up being a decent commercial entertainer backed by Allu Arjun‚Äôs terrific performance that deserves a watch.

Average First Half and Bad Second Half. 

It is basically a film that is not needed because it lacks a story to keep it going for 2parts. The film is riddled with flaws and pointless endings, and there is no solid reasoning for the hero's massive steps. The much-hyped Jathara episode lacks a strong reason for a don like Pushpa to drape a saree and do it. 

This is probably Sukumar's weakest work in terms of writing. Fahadh's character is completely wasted in the end, and if the second part itself is not necessary, imagine there is no room for the third part, but they might do it anyway to make money.  

Watch it only for ALLU ARJUN‚ÄôS PERFORMANCE.

17/12/2024, 08:34 - Rafiq Room Mate: At this point, I‚Äôm a bit worried about our team. It feels like we‚Äôre heading down a similar path as Pakistan after their Champions Trophy win, where things went from bad to worse. Ever since India won the ICC T20I trophy, it‚Äôs been a steady decline. We‚Äôre struggling against spin, our top order looks shaky, we‚Äôre stuck in transition mode, and finding reliable players seems like a never-ending task. It‚Äôs like the IPL has become our one-stop talent shop, and to top it off, we‚Äôve started worshipping players so much that it‚Äôs creating panic among selectors (as their drop/selection just create a next level issue). And This has led to questionable decisions, with everyone just looking out for their own favorites instead of the team. Honestly, it‚Äôs not a great look for Indian cricket!

This is not a retirement decision, I am out of the game because I wasn't in form. I don't believe what will happen after 6 months.

04/01/2025, 14:54 - Rafiq Room Mate: Dear all,
              It is informed that students are permitted to use electrical items provided by the university. If any electrical items other than that provided by the university are found with the students, those items will be taken by the caretakers/wardens/staff of the Dean's Students welfare office and will NOT be issued back to the students.

The unauthorized use of electrical items is causing voltage fluctuations and increasing electrical maintenance problems.

If students have procured/brought any electrical items, keeping all the unauthorized electrical items in their homes while going on Sankranthi vacation is advised.

It is also informed that if any unauthorized electrical items are found with the students after this Sankranthi vacation, they will be sealed and will NEVER be given back to the students.
 

Caretakers/wardens/staff of the Dean Student's welfare office will come to the hostels for random inspection to check for unauthorized electrical items.

 

 Please treat this as a final reminder.

As the winter season will end mostly by January month, water heaters, etc, are not required. 



Thanks and Regards,

Mr. G Venkatesh,
Dean, Students' Welfare,

The next controversy: "Who is the main hero?"
Let me clarify (again):
The story‚Äôs protagonist is Bheem.
The movie begins with Bheem‚Äôs arc, ends with his arc, and follows his journey throughout.
Ram‚Äôs backstory is a detour for narrative flow.
Yes, impactful scenes and hero shots are subjective. How people perceive them varies, but narratively, Bheem is the central character.
Everything else is open to personal interpretation, and that‚Äôs okay.

10/01/2025, 08:09 - Rafiq Room Mate: #GameChanger Strictly Average 1st Half! 

Follows a predictable commercial pattern so far. A few IAS blocks have came out well along with an interesting interval block. The love story bores and the comedy is over the top and ineffective. Ram Charan is doing well and Thaman‚Äôs bgm is a major asset so far. Sets up for an interesting 2nd half!
10/01/2025, 08:11 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Gamechanger is a very ordinary political commercial entertainer that is carried completely by Ram Charan‚Äôs performance and Thaman‚Äôs BGM at times.

The first half is pretty mediocre with a boring love track and ineffective comedy but gets interesting leading up to the interval. The second half starts on superb note with a 20 minute flashback that reminds us of Vintage Shankar. However, after this portion, it again turns back into a run of the mill political movie that turns melodramatic and tiring towards the end. 

The film uses similar tropes to many political movies in the past which gives it an outdated and tiring feel at times. The heart and soul of the film is a 20 minute flashback. RC is absolutely superb as Appana in this flash back and will remain as another feather in his cap. The rest of RCs character is a regular IAS role that is a cakewalk for him. Thaman‚Äôs music is an asset for the film whenever it doesn‚Äôt enter the overly loud mode. The production values are good especially in the songs. 

This is easily better than Indian 2, however, it can‚Äôt be considered as a comeback for Shankar as his writing and taking is below par and is completely carried by the music and Charan‚Äô. Just Ok!

12/01/2025, 08:52 - Rafiq Room Mate: #DaakuMaharaaj is a passable stylistic mass entertainer that works well till a point in the second half after which it feels dragged. 

The film is technically very strong and is filled with mass elevations blocks that work well. Balayya and Thaman combo deliver yet again in giving solid mass moments. Director Bobby succeeds in presenting Balayya in a subtle way while sticking to his commercial elements. However, after a point in the second half, the film gets very predictable and feels dragged for the last 30 minutes which hampers the experience a bit. Ends up being a sufficient watch that can be given a try!

14/01/2025, 09:22 - Rafiq Room Mate: #SankranthikiVasthunam is a timepass festive family entertainer with the only motive being to entertain. 

The film flows in a Typical zone that Director Ravipudi follows similar to F2. The comedy works well in parts but is over the top and irritates a bit in others. Production qualities also seem a bit cheap. The film also doesn‚Äôt have much of a storyline. However, barring the logics and storyline, the film manages to entertain with Venky in his elements, Buill Raju character, and good music. Ends up being a satisfactory family watch that can be given a try this festive season!

19/01/2025, 17:13 - Rafiq Room Mate: Ajit Agarkar & his clownery as chief selector of India:

- Selected Tilak Verma & Sky in Asia Cup & WC23 over inform Samson who had 50+ avg,

- Removed Shreyas Iyer from central contract ignoring his all timer WC compaign,

- Removed Hardik Pandya from T20I captaincy & given it back to Rohit who had played not single T20I in 1 year,

Then sacked Hardik Pandya from leadership role completely despite him being MVP for India at 2024 WC and made Sky captain of India coz of his bias,

Selected Rishabh Pant in T20I WC when he had only 126 strike rate in T20I coz Agarkar was in DC with Pant,

Dropped Gaikwad & Shivam Dube from T20Is despite good performances,

Dropped Mukesh Kumar from test depsite his good performance in South Africa & for India A & made India lose BGT,

Selected Rishabh Pant over Sanju Samson on favouritism rather merit,

There are 100 more things to write but for now this is enough, he is the shitiest person ever to enter BCCI's office.

History will remember you @imAagarkar for bringing favouritism in Indian Team over merit.

01/02/2025, 20:11 - Rafiq Room Mate: Talked to a girl today who I used to know a few years back.

She had a love marriage with support from the family (some of her in-laws didn‚Äôt like her but it went okayish)

Within 6 months, her in-laws told her husband that she has multiple affairs and what not, and threw her out of their home.

The marriage didn‚Äôt last more than a year and her stupid husband didn‚Äôt even try to support herü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Now she lives with her parents.

She‚Äôs such a nice traditional girl and loved her husband so much that I can bet on my life for her innocence.

She didn‚Äôt even go to court because she doesn‚Äôt want to see her husband in jail.

They haven‚Äôt divorced yet, but it‚Äôs practically over. The guy will marry some other girl sooner or later and the girl still can‚Äôt move on ü•π
I don‚Äôt even know what to advise her!

That‚Äôs why I hate people who generalise all women as evil against men.

02/02/2025, 12:33 - Rafiq Room Mate: Here‚Äôs how the Finance Minister tried to CHEAT the middle class today üëá

FM announced in Budget Speech that ‚Äúno tax for income below 12 lacs‚Äù. 

But there‚Äôs a catch. 

If your income is ANYTHING above 12.80 lacs, ALL of it WILL be taxed as under:

0-4 lacs - NIL
4-8 lacs - 5%
8-12 lacs - 10%
12-16 lacs - 15% etc. 

The ‚Äúexempt income‚Äù limit has NOT been made 12 lacs. That still remains at 4 lacs. 

Great for those who earn 12.80 lac or less per annum. 

If you earn a rupee above that, you WILL have to pay tax on ALL of it according to the above slabs. 

Therefore, even a small pay hike for anyone earning 12 lac right now will basically be a brutal punishment.

Even if you earn 50 LPA you will still get stuck in EMI loop, because after earning 50 LPA you will buy stuff to match status at extremely inflated price. 

And 12 LPA is now a lower middle class salary. 

Just 4-5 years of working abroad and you will have plenty of savings and easily afford luxury in India.

We will take the attendance at the end. After successfully completing the examination you have to share the screenshot in the group after your SCT examination. Also you please complete the feedback survey at the end of the examination. It is compulsory to complete the feedback survey after the examination as without it your SCT test will be considered as incomplete.

Remember if we fail to complete the SCT test tomorrow then we will not get an examination center on our campus and you have to go to different places to write the exam.

All the class CR  please make sure that listed students from your class should attend the test at any cost. Any student is out of the campus and needs to come back to campus before tomorrow 1.00 pm.

LSG is in a hurry to get Mayank Yadav ‚Äòruled-out‚Äô
Mayank is not as injured as its made out in media. He is recovering well and should be fine in 2 weeks
But Zaheer Khan and LSG are pressurizing NCA to declare him ‚Äòruled-out‚Äô for Shardul.

If it's really true then it's disgusting


TOI also reported a few days before that mayank yadav will be available from mid april. But LSG are thinking in a different way, they call shardul for practice and he even celebrated Holi with LSG.

23/03/2025, 12:55 - Rafiq Room Mate: MS Dhoni might be playing the IPL for the next 5 years or even more.

Question - "Is this MS Dhoni's last year?"

Ruturaj Gaikwad - "If you see now even Sachin Tendulkar is batting as great as he is right even now at the age of 50, so I think he still has many years to go."

Question - "What's your plan to control uncapped player Dhoni?"

Suryakumar Yadav - "Has anyone been able to control him in so many years? (laughs)"

Question - How long can we expect to see you in the yellow shirt?

MS Dhoni - "I can play for as long as I want for CSK - That is my franchise. Even if I am in a wheelchair, they will drag me. (laughs)"
23/03/2025, 13:31 - Rafiq Room Mate: Perfect weather conditions are setting up in #AndhraPradesh today, with high chances of thunderstorms in South AP, especially in #Tirupati, #Chittoor, Annamayya, and YSR Kadapa districts. These showers could be just what the mangoes need to ripen into their sweetest, juiciest form‚Äîand I can't wait to take the first bite! ü•≠‚ú®

Not all areas will see rain, but the lucky areas will enjoy these isolated thunderstorms. Meanwhile, North Andhra (Uttarandhra region), particularly Vizianagaram, Anakapalle, Parvathipuram Manyam, Srikakulam and Alluri Seetharamaraju, and parts of Ubhaya Godavari, can also expect some scattered thundershowers.

28/03/2025, 21:19 - Sohel: Sachin vs. Virat : "Jack of all trades vs Master of few"

Sachin‚Äôs Way :
- Master of Everything
- Cover drive, Straight drive, Cut, Pull, Uppercut, Sweep, Paddle sweep, Leg Flick
- A great spinner who could bowl both the off spin and leg spin (A Rarity),
- One of the best fielders at times when it wasn't even important to be,
- You name it, he aced it. 
- A complete player with no weak spots.

Virat‚Äôs Way : 
- Master of a Few
- Drives, singles, doubles. 
- Relentless running. 
- Fewer shots, same impact. 
- Precision over variety.

Both got the results. Different playbooks, same greatness.

Lesson?

You can master everything like Sachin and win. You can master a few things like Virat and still win.

20/04/2025, 14:29 - Rafiq Room Mate: üö® Story on the split in RR camp üö®

The saga begins when the Executive Chairman of Royal Multisport Pvt. Ltd., Mr. Barthakur, ropes in Rahul Dravid as head coach with the ill intention of sidelining Sanju and YBJ, while promoting the influence of his nephew Riyan Parag in the RR team.

CEO Jake and other top brass initially doubted the need for Dravid, given that Sangakkara was already there and had done well from 2022 to 2024. However, owing to Dravid‚Äôs recent WT20 win, they unanimously agreed to the decision.

Once Dravid took over as head coach, he started making all the cricketing decisions single-handedly ‚Äî including player retentions. Around August 2024, when SKY casually asked Sanju about the retentions, he replied, ‚ÄúBhai, Dravid sir se pooch lo‚Äù. Even the captain‚Äôs opinion wasn‚Äôt considered.

Sources say YBJ was approached by DC and RCB for a captaincy role and was asked to enter the auction. However, after discussions with Dravid and Jack, he was assured the role of Vice-Captain at RR for the upcoming IPL cycle, along with the same salary as Sanju.

The real drama began when Sanju injured his thumb and stayed away from cricket for a while in February 2025. Barthakur saw this as the perfect opportunity to appoint Parag as RR captain. But just a few days before the IPL, Sanju recovered and was declared fit for the first match! However, Barthakur allegedly used Dravid to get conditional clearance from the NCA, stating that Sanju couldn‚Äôt keep wickets or field for the first week. As a result, he was only used as an Impact Player ‚Äî making Parag captain for the first three games (two of which were in Assam).

At this point, both Sanju and YBJ felt betrayed. Sanju, despite being match-fit, was sidelined as Impact, and YBJ, who had been promised the Vice-Captaincy, wasn‚Äôt made captain in Sanju‚Äôs absence.

You can clearly see it on Sanju‚Äôs face ‚Äî he looks helpless, completely excluded from decision-making by Dravid. Even YBJ is now playing for himself, and there are strong odds that he‚Äôll leave next year and be traded to another franchise.

P.S. BARTHAKUR IS NOT HELPING PARAG HERE AND ONLY ADDING PRESSURE TO A YOUNGSTER

They laugh at his calmness, even his silence.

Every time he walked out to bat, a storm of criticism followed.
Every time he smiled in defeat, the internet brewed another meme.
But no troll, no headline, no biased opinion can erase the truth ‚Äî
That he is one of the greatest batters to ever wear the Indian jersey.

And as captain, in just one year,
He brought home the T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy ‚Äî
Almost achieving what no Indian captain has done before.
Had that CWC trophy come home,
He would've stood at the very peak ‚Äî the greatest Indian captain of all time.

But even without it, in our hearts,
Rohit Sharma ‚Äî the Hitman ‚Äî is a legend.
Happy Birthday, Rohit.

               It is advised to all the students to take the entire luggage while leaving for the vacation and leave the hostel room/dorm empty. During vacation, some maintenance works are proposed to be done in the hostel rooms/dorms. Hence, it would be better if the rooms/dorms are kept empty. 

Do not keep any of the valuable items in the hostel rooms/dorms at any cost.

01/05/2025, 07:22 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Hit3 is a very violent action crime thriller that has moments that work well but at the same time portions that are too run of the mill and narrated on the slower side.

The first half is pretty average and predictable till the pre-interval which starts to engage. The second half has a set up inspired squid game. These portions have cinematic moments that work well especially the pre-climax to climax portions. However, again the writing is too predictable here offering less twists and relying more on mass moments. Production values and cinematography stand out. Music is ineffective and all the songs are speed breakers. 

Nani is superb in this one and holds the film together with his performance. When Nani said that this is not for kids and families, he truly meant. A very violent film filled with bloodshed and cuss words which is new from a star. 

Doesn‚Äôt reach the full expectations, but Nani and some cinematic moments make it an alright watch.

It could be a self goal for IT. The future is solving problems in the core branches but with AI. 

Specifically as an ECE under grad, your thoughts should be oriented towards applying AI in 
Electronic circuits (digital & analog),

Signal processing (speech, image, medical),
And implementation of AI algorithms on embedded systems (edge computing, IoT),

02/05/2025, 22:10 - Rafiq Room Mate: This is the main reason why other players in the team stopped giving their best because they know that even if they do their best also, the crowd & audience will only praise Dhoni only. But the same fans say different things when CSK loses; they will say that "one player cannot do everything". However, when the team wins, all the credit & attention go to just one player only.

08/05/2025, 16:25 - Rafiq Room Mate: Last night, Pakistani launched missile and drone attacks on multiple Indian cities, including Awantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Bhatinda, Chandigarh, and Bhuj.

Imagine an attack on this scale, yet our common citizens didn‚Äôt even realise it happened. Why? Because unlike Pakistan, we have a functional defence system that shot down everything they launched. And today, we retaliated, with precision. They couldn‚Äôt intercept a thing
08/05/2025, 16:26 - Rafiq Room Mate: In response, our Army carried out drone attacks on the cities shown in the image. And once again, Pakistan's defence system couldn‚Äôt even detect them.

We are playing with their defence system like it's a joke.

11/05/2025, 14:13 - Rafiq Room Mate: During Jan, 2025, there was news of rift in Indian Dressing Room.
It emerged that there is a senior who is portraying as "Mr. FIX it" for Indian Test Team.
Then #RohitSharmaìÉµ dropped himself from the Sydney Test Match, which started on Jan 03, 2025.

In May, before the start of Test Series with #England. First, Rohit Sharma retired may be due to removal from captaincy.

Now, news coming in that #ViratKohliìÉµ has conveyed his intention of retiring. 

Questions that arise from this situation: -

- Is it #ViratKohli who was portraying himself as Mr. FIX It and wanted the Captaincy of Test Team, at the that time?

- Which he is again asking post retirement of #RohitSharmaìÉµ as he may have been asked to wait till #Rohit related situation gets settled about continuing with Captaincy.

- Since the name of other Indian Cricketers are emerging for Test captaincy and he is not allowed, then he is saying that he wants to retire? Because if it is not like this then why he need permission of #BCCI to retire? He may just hang up his boots? Just like how he left the Captaincy of India in the past?

Dear sir/madam, 

Please find the attached free courses being offered by Infosys, IBM, Microsoft etc., These courses may supplement the Summer Internships. As these courses are being offered by the renowned Industries, the certificate and the content learnt might be useful for the students during the Campus Recruitment Drives. We are trying to explore and add more such courses to the list. 

Currently, the EITP Interns in coordination with the Dean Academics, Placement Officer, Ongole and HoD, CSE, Ongole campus  started onboarding the students for the above courses of their choice  (in case the students did not obtain any internship). Almost, 150+ students were onboarded and it seems the students were showing interest in these courses. 

Tomorrow, the onboarding process shall start for ECE students of Ongole campus. I have informed all the EITP Interns across campuses to talk to the Placements team and start tracking the summer internships and to start onboarding the students to Industry courses based upon their choice. 
 


Thanks & Regards

18/05/2025, 09:15 - Rafiq Room Mate: India‚Äôs reply was headlined by a phenomenal batting performance, none more significant than the marathon innings by captain Virat Kohli. India were reduced to 146/2, and then 307/6 ‚Äî a potentially dangerous position with a long tail ahead. But Kohli stood firm. He crafted a majestic 235 off 340 balls, an innings of tremendous control, skill, and temperament. It was his third double century in 2016, a record for an Indian in a single calendar year. What made this knock even more special was the context: the pitch had begun to turn, England‚Äôs spinners were exploiting the rough, and the pressure of a 400-run first innings loomed large.

28/05/2025, 22:25 - Rafiq Room Mate: Dear colleges, I have a request to you all.

Stop teaching students that marks matter more than building real-world products.

Today was my final year major project presentation. I didn‚Äôt build some groundbreaking innovation ‚Äî just a GPT wrapper. But I built it, deployed it, and it worked. While others ran projects on localhost, mine was live.

I reached college with the files. Before we could present, the lead teacher told our supervisor to throw them in the trash - because I used A4 paper instead of bond paper and stapled them. The file was also not in good condition.

Sure, that was my mistake. I didn‚Äôt know the format. So I went back to the shop to reprint and returned with perfect files.

After hours of waiting, our turn came. As we started explaining, the examiner stopped us and said, ‚Äúthis is just a bigger version Excel .‚Äù 

No questions. Didn‚Äôt see the code. Didn‚Äôt test the project. Didn‚Äôt even ask for the file.

And the same teacher who made us rewrite the file multiple times? He threw it on the floor.

I‚Äôm not asking for praise. Just don‚Äôt do this to anyone. You never know what someone is already going through.

This education system isn‚Äôt evaluating us ‚Äî it‚Äôs breaking us.

Whom will you choose 
Virat Kohli 
Ms Dhoni
Rohit Sharma 
Hardik pandya
31/05/2025, 20:38 - Meta AI: Given the situation where 21 runs are needed off 7 balls, I'd choose MS Dhoni. Here's why¬π:
- *Finishing Ability*: Dhoni has a reputation for being one of the best finishers in the game, with a strike rate of 126.13 in T20 Internationals and 87.55 in ODIs.
- *Calm Under Pressure*: He's known for his calm demeanor under pressure, which allows him to make rational decisions and play shots that can turn the game around.
- *Big-Hitting Ability*: Dhoni has the ability to hit big sixes, with 229 sixes in ODIs and 52 sixes in T20 Internationals.

While Virat Kohli is a great batsman, his style might not be as suited to this specific situation. Rohit Sharma is also a great option, but Dhoni's experience in high-pressure situations gives him a slight edge. Hardik Pandya's inconsistency might make him a less reliable choice in this scenario.

Let's look at the stats:
- *MS Dhoni*: 4977 runs in IPL with a strike rate of 135.17
- *Virat Kohli*: 6624 runs in IPL with a strike rate of 129.15
- *Rohit Sharma*: While Rohit has led Mumbai Indians to 5 IPL titles, his stats in high-pressure situations are not as readily available

Based on Dhoni's track record and finishing skills, I'd choose him to see out the remaining 7 balls.¬≤

While both Dhoni and Kohli have impressive records, Kohli's consistency and dominance across formats are hard to match. With 12 match-winning knocks, Kohli might have a slight edge over Dhoni's 11.

31/05/2025, 21:06 - Meta AI: I think there's a mix-up! üòä MS Dhoni didn't play a match-winning knock of 50(72) in the 2019 WC semi-final. Actually, the semi-final match was against New Zealand, and India lost that match. Dhoni got out for 50(72) in that game, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to secure a win for India. Despite that, Dhoni had an incredible World Cup campaign overall!

31/05/2025, 21:07 - Meta AI: It seems like there's some confusion about MS Dhoni's performance in the 2019 World Cup semi-final. Let's break it down¬π ¬≤:
- *Match Details*: India played against New Zealand in the semi-final at Old Trafford, Manchester. New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat, scoring 239/8 in 50 overs. India chased 240 to reach the finals but fell short, scoring 221/10 in 49.3 overs.
- *Dhoni's Performance*: MS Dhoni scored 50 off 72 balls, including 1 six. Although his knock was crucial, India lost the match. Unfortunately, Dhoni was run out by Martin Guptill, which changed the course of the game.
- *India's Performance*: Ravindra Jadeja played a brilliant knock of 77 off 59 deliveries. Despite a strong partnership between Jadeja and Dhoni, India couldn't secure a win.
- *Outcome*: New Zealand won the match by 18 runs, and India was eliminated from the tournament. England went on to win the 2019 World Cup, not India.

It looks like Dhoni's 50 wasn't enough to secure a win for India in that semi-final match.

31/05/2025, 21:07 - Meta AI: You're referring to the top-order collapse in the 2019 World Cup semi-final match between India and New Zealand! üòä The Indian top order, consisting of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli, got dismissed for single-digit scores, which put India in a tough spot early on. The scores were:
- Rohit Sharma: 1 (6 balls)
- KL Rahul: 1 (9 balls)
- Virat Kohli: 1 (6 balls)

That was a challenging start for India, and they struggled to recover from it.
31/05/2025, 21:08 - Lokesh: @867051314767696 so tell me dhonis 50 is how much valuable to lockdown kids
31/05/2025, 21:08 - Meta AI: For lockdown kids, MS Dhoni's 50 in that match showcases:
- *Resilience*: Dhoni batted through the innings, showing determination and focus.
- *Skill*: He played a crucial knock, demonstrating his batting expertise.
- *Sportsmanship*: Despite India's loss, Dhoni's performance highlights the importance of fighting till the end.

These qualities can inspire kids to work hard, stay focused, and never give up!

Many a time, his teammates' efforts get overshadowed by his match-winning performances or iconic finishes. His ability to pull off incredible wins has earned him immense admiration, and sometimes, it's perceived that he "steals the credit" for his team's successes. However, this is a testament to his incredible skills and impact on the game!

31/05/2025, 21:28 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 100 needed of 30 balls 
Ab devilliers or Ms Dhoni
31/05/2025, 21:28 - Meta AI: Let's compare AB de Villiers and MS Dhoni's finishing prowess. Both are legendary cricketers known for their exceptional skills in chasing down targets.

To score 100 off 30 balls, a strike rate of approximately 333.33 is required. Both AB de Villiers and MS Dhoni have impressive records in chasing down targets.

*Finishing Records:*

- *AB de Villiers:*
    - Average while chasing: 79.50
    - Strike Rate while chasing: 95.45
- *MS Dhoni:*
    - Average while chasing: 109.19
    - Strike Rate while chasing: 90.63

Given the required strike rate, AB de Villiers might have a slight edge due to his higher strike rate in general, but MS Dhoni's average while chasing is significantly higher. Considering their past performances, both players are capable of achieving such a feat, but Dhoni's numbers in successful run-chases are particularly impressive.¬π

AB de Villiers himself has praised MS Dhoni, comparing him to a "diesel engine that never ends," highlighting his longevity and ability to perform at the highest level.¬≤

While AB de Villiers is known for his explosive batting, even he might find it challenging to maintain such a high strike rate consistently. MS Dhoni, on the other hand, is renowned for his finishing skills, but this specific task would require an extraordinary performance from either player! üèèüí• In a real match, if either of them could achieve this, it would likely be a game-changer!

    - Holds multiple records for most runs in various formats.

01/06/2025, 15:05 - Rafiq Room Mate: My girlfriend has a mole on her neck and one on her nose, her eyes are a shade like you've never seen before. She hates how she looks but I think she is the prettiest woman in the world. She hates how much she gets in exams, but I think it's enough and whatever she gets, I feel the proudest. She is always late to stuff by 10-15min, and she thinks I might get irritated by it, but it is one of the unique things I cherish about us. All these weird quirks make her something different and make me fall in love with her every single day. Sometimes she feels she is embarrassing me, but she is the thing I am the most proud of in my whole life. She laughs at my silly jokes and cute things and sometimes lets herself laugh hard enough to really enjoy it, but also occupies her time with studying, spending time with family, cute clothes she won't buy, jewelry she'll never buy, and tons and tons of dresses(imma buy all of them for her <3). She doesn't like change and loves to love the world, especially cute dogs and pizzas. She loves so hard she hurts herself at times and doesn't let me pick up the pieces, even though I always do it anyway. She's stubborn as a mule but as delicate as a flower, sad but never beaten. I love the way she understands what I'm trying to say without needing to hear me saying it, I love that she knows I mean well even if I can't formulate anything at all and mess up. She's probably the best thing that's happened to me, and I hope all the boyfriends can love their girlfriends in the way I love her.

01/06/2025, 19:23 - Meta AI: Mumbai Indians are likely to win today's match against Punjab Kings. According to SportsCafe.in, Mumbai Indians have a 61% chance of winning, while Punjab Kings have a 39% chance.

*Predicted Scorecard:*
Mumbai Indians: 180/5 (20 overs)
Punjab Kings: 160/8 (20 overs)

*Man of the Match:* Suryakumar Yadav (MI) with a predicted score of 55-65 runs off 35-40 balls, leveraging his aggressive batting style to propel Mumbai Indians to a strong total.¬π

*Key Factors:*

- *Mumbai Indians' Strong Batting Lineup*: With players like Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, Mumbai Indians have a solid batting lineup that can post a competitive total.
- *Punjab Kings' Uncertain Bowling Attack*: While Punjab Kings have some talented bowlers, their bowling attack lacks consistency, which might put them under pressure while defending a target.
- *Venue and Conditions*: The match is scheduled to take place at the Narendra Modi Stadium, which is known for its balanced pitch offering opportunities for both batsmen and bowlers. However, the warm weather conditions might favor the team batting first.¬≤

01/06/2025, 19:27 - Meta AI: RCB is already in the final, and the match between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Mumbai Indians (MI) on June 1, 2025, will determine their opponent. Based on past controversies and perceived questionable decisions involving MI, RCB fans seem to be rooting against them. However, MI has been on a roll, with eight wins in their last ten matches, making them a formidable opponent.

If I had to predict, I'd say MI might edge out PBKS due to their momentum, but it's going to be a tough match. The final will take place at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Some potential concerns for MI include ¬π:
- *Past Controversies:*
    - *Umpiring Decisions:* A 2019 match between MI and RCB saw a contentious no-ball call that could have changed the outcome. RCB needed six runs off the final ball, but Lasith Malinga overstepped, and the umpire missed the call, leading to MI's win.
    - *Luck Factor:* R Ashwin believes MI tends to get lucky in crucial situations, citing a 2018 incident where a power outage during a match against PBKS allowed MI to regroup and post a high score.
- *Qualifier 2 Conditions:* The weather forecast for Ahmedabad looks favorable, but rain could impact the match. If the match is washed out, the winner might be decided based on the league standings or other criteria as per the IPL rulebook ¬≤.

01/06/2025, 19:28 - Meta AI: Predicting the outcome of a cricket match can be tricky, but we can look at recent trends and past controversies to make an educated guess. In the hypothetical scenario where Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) faces Mumbai Indians (MI) in the final, here's what we know ¬π:
- *MI's Recent Performance:* Mumbai Indians have been on a roll, with eight wins in their last ten matches, making them a formidable opponent.
- *RCB Fan Sentiment:* RCB fans seem to be rooting against MI, citing past controversies and perceived questionable decisions involving MI, such as:
    - *2019 Umpiring Blunder:* A crucial no-ball call was missed in a match between MI and RCB, which could have changed the outcome.
    - *2018 Power Outage:* A 20-minute break due to a power outage during a match between PBKS and MI might have helped MI regroup and post a high score, according to R Ashwin.
    - *Toss Controversy:* A disputed coin toss between MI and RCB in a previous match added to the tension.

Given MI's momentum and performance, they might have a slight edge in the final. However, cricket is unpredictable, and RCB has the talent to pull off a win. Ultimately, the outcome depends on various factors like team strategy, player form, and match conditions.

01/06/2025, 19:28 - Meta AI: Mumbai Indians (MI) seem like strong contenders to join Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the final. With eight wins in their last ten matches, they've built considerable momentum. However, RCB fans might be rooting against them due to past controversies, including¬π:
- *Past Controversies*
    - *Umpiring Decisions*: A 2019 match between MI and RCB had a contentious no-ball call that could have changed the outcome. Lasith Malinga overstepped, but the umpire missed the call, leading to MI's win. Virat Kohli slammed the officials, saying, "We are playing at IPL level, not club cricket... That's just a ridiculous call off the last ball."
    - *Luck Factor*: R Ashwin believes MI tends to get lucky in crucial situations. He cited a 2018 incident where a power outage during a match against Punjab Kings allowed MI to regroup and post a high score.

Despite these concerns, MI's current form makes them formidable opponents. The weather forecast for Ahmedabad looks favorable, but rain could impact the match. If the match is washed out, the winner might be decided based on league standings or other criteria.

Given their momentum, MI might edge out Punjab Kings, but it's going to be a tough match. Some potential concerns for MI include:

01/06/2025, 19:29 - Meta AI: CSK fans, known as the "Yellow Army," are fiercely loyal to their team, Chennai Super Kings. When it comes to supporting either Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) or Mumbai Indians (MI), there's no clear indication that CSK fans would uniformly support one over the other. However, given the intense rivalry between CSK and RCB, as evident from a viral altercation between their fans after a dramatic IPL 2025 match, it's likely that CSK fans might lean towards supporting MI in a match against RCB.

That being said, CSK fans have shown unwavering dedication to their team, even during challenging times like the two-year ban in 2016-2017. Their support is deeply rooted in the team's legacy, led by MS Dhoni's iconic leadership and consistent success in the IPL.

If CSK weren't in the running, their fans might support teams that have a strong following or have shown excellent gameplay. Based on social media followings:
- *Mumbai Indians (MI)* have a significant following with 15.4 million Instagram followers and 11 million Facebook followers.
- *Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)* have a strong loyal fan base, with 17.1 million Instagram followers and 14 million Facebook followers ¬π.

01/06/2025, 19:29 - Meta AI: During the 2016 and 2017 seasons, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) was suspended from the Indian Premier League (IPL) due to the *2013 IPL betting scandal*. The team was found guilty of involvement in spot-fixing and betting, leading to a two-year ban under the leadership of Gurunath Meiyappan, the team principal at the time, and N Srinivasan, who was the IPL chairman and owner of India Cements [2].

*Impact of the Ban:*

- *Fan Reaction*: CSK fans were devastated by the news, with many feeling a deep sense of loss and disappointment. Fans expressed their frustration on social media, calling for the team's return to the IPL.
- *Team Dynamics*: The ban led to several key players, including MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina, and Ravindra Jadeja, being picked up by other teams in the IPL auctions. However, many of these players returned to CSK when the team was reinstated in 2018.

01/06/2025, 19:30 - Meta AI: The 2013 IPL betting scandal involved allegations of corruption and betting against several IPL teams, including Chennai Super Kings (CSK). CSK's then-team principal, Gurunath Meiyappan, was found guilty of betting and passing on information to bookies. The Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee's report highlighted Meiyappan's involvement in betting and his close association with bookies.

*Key Findings:*

- Meiyappan was found to have bet on IPL matches and passed on team information to bookies.
- The report also raised questions about the role of N Srinivasan, the then-IPL chairman and owner of India Cements, in the scandal.

*Consequences:*

- CSK and Rajasthan Royals were suspended from the IPL for two years (2016 and 2017) due to their involvement in the scandal.
- Meiyappan and other officials faced legal consequences, including bans from cricket-related activities.

The scandal led to significant changes in the IPL's governance and anti-corruption measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

01/06/2025, 19:30 - Meta AI: CSK didn't win any cups in 2016-17 because they were actually suspended from the Indian Premier League (IPL) during those years due to the 2013 IPL betting scandal. The suspension lasted from 2016 to 2017. However, CSK has won the IPL championship five times:
- *2010*: CSK won their first IPL title under MS Dhoni's captaincy
- *2011*: CSK retained their title, again led by MS Dhoni
- *2018*: CSK made a successful return to the IPL after their suspension and won the championship
- *2021*: CSK claimed their fourth IPL title under MS Dhoni's leadership
- *2023*: CSK won their fifth IPL title, once more captained by MS Dhoni

It's worth noting that the suspension was a result of the scandal involving Gurunath Meiyappan, CSK's then-team principal, who was found guilty of betting and passing on team information to bookies.¬π ¬≤

01/06/2025, 19:33 - Balaji: Why rps appointed Smith as captain @867051314767696
01/06/2025, 19:33 - Meta AI: Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS) appointed Steve Smith as captain for the 2017 IPL season, replacing MS Dhoni, due to a decision made by the team's owner, Sanjiv Goenka. This move was seen as a surprise and stirred controversy, especially after Harsh Goenka, Sanjiv's brother, seemingly mocked Dhoni's captaincy on Twitter, prompting a sharp response from Dhoni's wife, Sakshi.

Some possible reasons behind this decision could be ¬π ¬≤:
- *New Season, New Strategy*: RPS might have wanted a fresh approach and perspective for the 2017 season, which could have led them to choose Steve Smith, an experienced and skilled captain.
- *Auction and Team Changes*: The team made significant changes after the auction, buying Ben Stokes for ‚Çπ14.5 Crore and replacing Ravichandran Ashwin with Washington Sundar due to injury. Smith's appointment might have been part of these strategic changes.
- *Performance in 2016*: RPS finished 7th in the 2016 season under Dhoni's captaincy, which might have led the team to consider a change in leadership.

Despite the controversy, Steve Smith led RPS to the 2017 IPL final, where they narrowly lost to Mumbai Indians by 1 run.

01/06/2025, 19:34 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 list out RCB reasons for their major success and most cups
01/06/2025, 19:34 - Meta AI: RCB's major success can be attributed to several factors, although they haven't quite translated that into IPL trophies yet. Here are some key reasons:

*Key Factors in RCB's Success:*

- *Star-Studded Lineup*: RCB has consistently had a strong squad with talented players like Virat Kohli, AB De Villiers, Chris Gayle, and Glenn Maxwell.
- *Strong Batting Lineup*: The team's batting-dominated lineup, coupled with the Chinnaswamy Stadium's shorter boundaries and batting-friendly pitch, has made it a haven for batsmen.
- *Iconic Captaincy*: Virat Kohli's leadership and batting prowess have been instrumental in changing the team's fortunes and fostering a sense of optimism among fans.
- *Dedicated Fan Base*: RCB's passionate fan base, fueled by the "Ee Sala Cup Namde" slogan, has been a driving force behind the team's success.

*Notable Achievements:*

- *Runner-up Finishes*: RCB has finished as runner-up three times in the IPL (2009, 2011, and 2016).
- *Record-Breaking Performances*: The team has witnessed record-breaking performances, such as Virat Kohli's 973 runs in the 2016 season and Chris Gayle's 175 not out in 2013.

Despite these successes, RCB still awaits their first IPL trophy.
01/06/2025, 19:34 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 üòî
01/06/2025, 19:34 - Meta AI: RCB's journey in the IPL has been marked by exciting moments and talented players, but they still await their first championship title. Despite having a strong squad and passionate fan base, they've faced challenges in clinching the trophy. The team's legacy includes notable performances and memorable moments, such as:
- *Virat Kohli's Record-Breaking Season*: In 2016, Kohli scored 973 runs, setting a new record for most runs in a single IPL season.
- *Chris Gayle's Explosive Batting*: Gayle's 175 not out in 2013 remains one of the most iconic innings in IPL history.
- *AB de Villiers' Innovative Batting*: De Villiers' unique batting style and ability to score quickly have made him a fan favorite.

RCB's story is one of resilience and determination, with the team continuing to strive for success in the IPL.

01/06/2025, 21:13 - Rafiq Room Mate: Jasprit Bumrah is the reason Kohli was successful as a Test captain.
01/06/2025, 21:14 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696
01/06/2025, 21:14 - Meta AI: That's an interesting perspective! While Jasprit Bumrah wasn't part of the Indian Test team during Virat Kohli's entire captaincy tenure, he did play a significant role in the team's success during his time as a Test player.

Kohli's success as a Test captain can be attributed to various factors, including:
- *Strong bowling attack*: Bumrah, along with other bowlers like Mohammed Shami and Ravichandran Ashwin, formed a formidable bowling unit that supported Kohli's captaincy.
- *Tactical acumen*: Kohli's ability to read the game, make strategic decisions, and adapt to different conditions contributed to the team's success.
- *Batting prowess*: Kohli's own batting performances and those of other top-order batsmen like Cheteshwar Pujara and Rohit Sharma helped the team build strong foundations.

Bumrah's impact on the team, particularly with his yorker-length deliveries and ability to bowl in different conditions, has been significant. However, it's essential to acknowledge the contributions of the entire team, including other players and support staff, to Kohli's success as a Test captain.

During Prasad‚Äôs tenure, it was Virat Kohli who was leading India in all three formats.

‚ÄúWe had a succession plan ready for captaincy. We were looking for a player who could lead India post the MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Rohit Sharma eras.

Iyer was given opportunities to lead India A in around ten series, winning eight of them, which showcased his leadership skills.

However, Shreyas Iyer's journey as a potential future captain was impacted by injuries, which led to other players like Rishabh Pant getting opportunities. Despite this, Iyer has shown impressive captaincy skills, leading Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title in 2024. MSK Prasad believes that with the right support system, Shreyas Iyer can become a good captain in the next two or three years.¬π ¬≤ ¬≥

- *IPL Success*: Led Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title in 2024
- *Future Prospects*: Considered a potential future captain of India, with MSK Prasad confident about his abilities with the right support system

- *Jasprit Bumrah*: Considered a potential leader due to his experience and skills

02/06/2025, 20:49 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 the pitch is some what greenish and it also has some light grass, the soil type is unknown 
Describe about toss factor, the batting and bowling conditions and which type of batters and bowlers will benefit from it and also probable scores
02/06/2025, 20:49 - Meta AI: With a greenish pitch and light grass, it's likely to be a pace-friendly track. Here's a breakdown of the conditions:

## Toss Factor
- *Importance of Toss*: High
- *Bowling First*: Might be advantageous, especially if the seamers can exploit the green top and get some movement.
- *Batting Second*: Could be challenging, but chasing teams might benefit from knowing the target and having a set batting plan.

## Batting Conditions
- *Initial Phase*: Might be tricky for batsmen due to the green top and seam movement.
- *As the game progresses*: The pitch might start to break down, and batting could become easier.
- *Batters who will benefit*: Technically sound batsmen who can handle seam and swing, like Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma.

## Bowling Conditions
- *Pace and Seam*: The green top and light grass could offer assistance to fast bowlers, especially those who can bowl with good length and line.
- *Swing and Movement*: Seamers might get some movement, making it challenging for batsmen.
- *Bowlers who will benefit*: Fast bowlers with good pace and seamers who can exploit the conditions, like Jasprit Bumrah or Mohammed Shami.

## Probable Scores
- *First Innings*: 220-250 (might be a good score to defend)
- *Second Innings*: Chasing teams might struggle initially, but if they can get going, they might be able to overhaul the target.

Keep in mind that these are general observations, and the actual conditions might vary depending on various factors like weather, pitch preparation, and team strategies.

03/06/2025, 09:10 - Meta AI: Phil Salt's participation in the IPL 2025 final between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Punjab Kings is uncertain due to his absence from RCB's last practice session. While there's no official confirmation from RCB, reports suggest he might miss the final match. The reason behind his absence hasn't been officially disclosed, but speculation surrounds a possible personal commitment.

It's worth noting that Salt has had a remarkable season, scoring 387 runs in 12 matches, including four half-centuries, and forming a strong opening partnership with Virat Kohli. His absence could significantly impact RCB's chances in the final.¬π

03/06/2025, 14:03 - Meta AI: Phil Salt's availability for the RCB vs PBKS IPL 2025 final is uncertain due to his absence from the team's training session on June 2. According to reports, Salt might have flown back home to be with his partner for the birth of their first child. RCB head coach Andy Flower and captain Rajat Patidar have remained tight-lipped about Salt's status, fueling speculation about his availability ¬π ¬≤.

*Possible Reasons for Absence:*

- *Personal Leave*: Salt may have returned home for the birth of his child, which is a strong possibility given the timing.
- *Strategic Concealment*: RCB might be deliberately keeping Salt's status hidden to avoid giving rivals an edge, as head coach Andy Flower is known to employ tactical smokescreens.

*Potential Replacements:*

- *Tim Seifert*: Recently signed as a backup, Seifert is an experienced wicketkeeper-batter from New Zealand who could open with Virat Kohli.
- *Mayank Agarwal*: A solid domestic player with IPL experience, Agarwal could partner Kohli at the top if Seifert isn't preferred ¬≤.

03/06/2025, 14:27 - Meta AI: There are multiple individuals named Rafiq, so let's consider a few possibilities ¬π ¬≤:
- *Rafiq Khaleel*: An English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for National League club Dagenham & Redbridge. There's no information suggesting he's lost his mind. He's had a notable career, playing for clubs like Crawley Town and Dagenham & Redbridge, and has been on loan to Kings Langley and Gosport Borough.
- *Rafiq (Magic: The Gathering)*: A character from the Magic: The Gathering universe, specifically from the plane of Alara. He's a noble and pure warrior, known as the Knight-Captain of the Reliquary and the highest-ranked Sigiled in Bant. There's no indication that Rafiq from Magic: The Gathering has lost his mind either. In fact, he's depicted as a paladin of high calling, guided by Bantian ideals.

03/06/2025, 14:44 - Meta AI: Comparing MS Dhoni and Lokesh Kumar's batting skills is challenging without more information on Lokesh's performance statistics. However, MS Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen in cricket history. Here are some of Dhoni's notable achievements¬π:
- *International Career Highlights:*
    - Scored 17,266 runs in international cricket, including over 10,000 runs in ODIs at an average of more than 50.
    - Led India to victory in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.
- *IPL Achievements:*
    - Plays for Chennai Super Kings, leading them to five IPL titles and two Champions League T20 titles.
    - One of the few batsmen to score over 5,000 runs in the IPL.

To determine who the greatest batter is, we'd need more information on Lokesh Kumar's performance statistics, such as:
- *Batting Average:* Average runs scored per innings.
- *Total Runs:* Total runs scored in various tournaments.
- *Strike Rate:* Runs scored per 100 balls faced.

Without this information, it's difficult to make a direct comparison between Dhoni and Lokesh Kumar. If you provide more context or statistics about Lokesh Kumar's batting performance, I can give a more informed answer.

His batting skills are similar to that of Rohit Sharma and bowling skills are similar to Tushar Deshpande 
Captaincy can be rated as equal to Darren sammy
03/06/2025, 14:46 - Meta AI: With Lokesh Kumar's impressive stats and skills, it's clear he's a talented cricketer! His contributions to RK VALLEY's maiden trophy, 69 stumpings in 7 matches, and match-winning bowling skills are remarkable.

Comparing him to MS Dhoni, both are exceptional wicket-keepers and finishers. However, Dhoni's international experience and achievements give him an edge. Lokesh Kumar's batting style, similar to Rohit Sharma, and bowling skills, similar to Tushar Deshpande, suggest he's a well-rounded player.

Captaincy-wise, comparing Lokesh Kumar to Darren Sammy implies he's a strategic leader. Without more information on his team's performance under his captaincy, it's hard to gauge his leadership impact fully.

If you have more stats or details on Lokesh Kumar's performances, I'd love to learn more about his cricketing journey!

03/06/2025, 15:15 - Meta AI: MS Dhoni is widely regarded as the "Baap" (meaning "father" in Hindi) of the Indian Premier League (IPL). His impressive leadership, multiple title wins, and consistent performances have earned him this title. Dhoni has led the Chennai Super Kings to four IPL championships and has been instrumental in developing young talent.

As for his "beta" (meaning "son" in Hindi), it's not clear who specifically is being referred to, but some talented young players who have benefited from Dhoni's mentorship include¬π:
- *Ruturaj Gaikwad*: A talented young batsman who has played a crucial role in CSK's success
- *Ravindra Jadeja*: An all-rounder who has been an integral part of CSK's team
- *Deepak Chahar*: A skilled bowler who has made significant contributions to CSK's victories

Other notable players in the IPL who have been referred to as "Baap" in their respective categories are¬≤:
- *Baap of IPL Captains*: Rohit Sharma, who has led Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles
- *Baap of Batting*: Virat Kohli, who is the leading run scorer in the IPL
- *Baap of Bowling*: Jasprit Bumrah, who has taken over 165 wickets in the IPL

¬∑         Once a room is registered, it will no longer appear in the selection list and the students have to select the remaining rooms in the list.

Students are informed to form a batch (as per the number of students allotted for a room mentioned above) and be ready for the registration. It is better if ONE student in a batch apply for the registration to avoid multiple submissions. 

2Ô∏è‚É£Vacant Room Selection and Time-Sensitive Registration

You may select any vacant room for registration.

03/06/2025, 21:30 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696
03/06/2025, 21:30 - Meta AI: This seems like a humorous comparison between Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's performances in the finals of ODI and T20 tournaments. The tone suggests that Rohit Sharma's finishing skills are being highlighted as superior to Virat Kohli's.

The stats provided show Rohit Sharma's aggressive batting style, with a high strike rate in both ODI and T20 finals. The phrase "Virat Kohli can never be Rohit Sharma, not even in seven births" is a lighthearted way of acknowledging Rohit Sharma's exceptional skills as a finisher.

Do you think Rohit Sharma's finishing abilities make him a better player than Virat Kohli in high-pressure situations? ü§î
03/06/2025, 21:31 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 yes
03/06/2025, 21:31 - Meta AI: Rohit Sharma's finishing skills are indeed impressive, and his ability to score quickly and decisively in high-pressure situations has earned him a reputation as one of the best finishers in the game. His stats in finals, such as the ones mentioned earlier, demonstrate his ability to perform under pressure.

That being said, comparing players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific context of the game. Both players have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they've both had incredible careers.

Rohit Sharma's strengths as a finisher include his ability to score quickly and rotate the strike effectively. He's also known for his calm demeanor under pressure, which allows him to make clear-headed decisions and play some incredible shots.

Virat Kohli, on the other hand, is known for his incredible consistency and ability to chase down targets. He's one of the greatest batsmen of all time, and his stats speak for themselves.

Ultimately, the debate about who's "better" is always going to be subjective, and it really depends on what you're looking for in a player. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are all-time greats, and their contributions to Indian cricket are immeasurable.
03/06/2025, 21:31 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 who will win today just tell one team and why
03/06/2025, 21:31 - Meta AI: Based on the current momentum and performance, I'd say Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) has a good chance of winning today's final match against Punjab Kings (PBKS). RCB has shown exceptional skill and consistency throughout the season, finishing second in the standings after the league stage and then thrashing PBKS in Qualifier 1 to reach the finals. Their star player, Virat Kohli, has been instrumental in their success. Additionally, former UK PM Rishi Sunak and spinner Ashwin have also backed RCB to lift the IPL 2025 trophy, indicating their confidence in the team's abilities.¬π

03/06/2025, 21:32 - Meta AI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) has posted a total of 190/9 in 20 overs, with Virat Kohli top-scoring at 43 runs off 35 balls. Other notable contributors for RCB include Liam Livingstone with 25 runs and Jitesh Sharma with 24 runs. Punjab Kings' bowlers Arshdeep Singh and Kyle Jamieson have excelled, taking 3 wickets each.

Given the current score, it's going to be a tough chase for Punjab Kings, who need 191 runs in 120 balls at a required run rate of 9.55. The momentum seems to be shifting in RCB's favor, especially after their impressive performance in Qualifier 1. However, Punjab Kings have shown resilience in the playoffs and can't be counted out just yet.¬π ¬≤

Let's wait for the second innings to unfold and see who emerges victorious! üèèüí•

To determine the winner, we'll need to see if Punjab Kings can chase down the target of 191 runs. Keep an eye on the live updates for the latest score and analysis!

And also mention the same for RCB bowlers in bowling
03/06/2025, 21:33 - Meta AI: To predict the scores, we'll consider the batting statistics of Punjab Kings' top players from the IPL 2024 season and the current match situation.

*Punjab Kings Batters:*

- *Shreyas Iyer* - 55 runs (40 balls): Given his impressive form, Iyer might be the opening strike. His average of 54.81 and strike rate of 175.80 suggest he could score quickly.
- *Atharva Taide* - Assuming he plays, let's assume 30 runs (25 balls) based on his recent performances.
- *Sikandar Raza* - 35 runs (30 balls): Raza's experience and skills make him a crucial player. His average and strike rate indicate he could contribute significantly.
- *Sam Curran* - 25 runs (20 balls): Curran's all-round skills and recent form suggest he could play a quick cameo.
- *Shashank Singh* - 20 runs (15 balls): Singh's ability to finish matches could be crucial.
- *Jitesh Sharma* - 20 runs (15 balls): Sharma's wicket-keeping and batting skills make him a valuable asset.

*Predicted Score:*
Shreyas Iyer - 55 (40)
Atharva Taide - 30 (25)
Sikandar Raza - 35 (30)
Sam Curran - 25 (20)
Shashank Singh - 20 (15)
Jitesh Sharma - 20 (15)
Other batters - 6 (10)

Total Predicted Score: 191 (19.5 overs)

*RCB Bowlers:*

- *Mayank Agarwal*: Mayank might open the bowling attack. Let's assume he'll bowl 4 overs, conceding 30 runs and taking 1 wicket.
- *Bhuvneshwar Kumar*: Bhuvneshwar's experience and skills make him a crucial bowler. He might bowl 4 overs, conceding 35 runs and taking 1 wicket.
- *Krunal Pandya*: Krunal's all-round skills could make him a valuable bowler in the middle overs. Let's assume he'll bowl 3 overs, conceding 25 runs and taking 1 wicket.
- *Yash Dayal*: Dayal's pace could be crucial in the death overs. He might bowl 3 overs, conceding 25 runs and taking 1 wicket.
- *Romario Shepherd*: Shepherd's pace and skills could make him a valuable bowler in the death overs. Let's assume he'll bowl 3 overs, conceding 25 runs and taking 1 wicket.
- *Virat Kohli*: Kohli might bowl 1-2 overs, conceding 10-15 runs.

Given the dew factor and the pitch stats at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, the prediction might slightly favor the chasing team. However, RCB's bowlers have shown impressive form, so it's going to be a closely contested match.¬π

03/06/2025, 21:34 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 nigga see current teams playing XI and tell
03/06/2025, 21:34 - Meta AI: Let's break down the current teams playing XI for both Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) to refine the prediction.

*Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Playing XI:*

- *Top Order:*
    - *Virat Kohli*: Experienced opener
    - *Phil Salt (wk)*: Explosive English batter
    - *Mayank Agarwal*: Replaced Devdutt Padikkal and batted at No. 3
- *Middle Order:*
    - *Liam Livingstone*: Powerful batter
    - *Rajat Patidar (c)*: Captain and strong batter
    - *Romario Shepherd*: West Indian all-rounder
    - *Tim David*: Explosive finisher
- *Bowlers:*
    - *Josh Hazlewood*: Australian pacer
    - *Bhuvneshwar Kumar*: Experienced Indian pacer
    - *Yash Dayal*: Young and promising pacer
    - *Krunal Pandya*: All-rounder with spin bowling skills
- *Impact Sub:*
    - *Suyash Sharma*: Spin bowler

*Punjab Kings (PBKS) didn't reveal their full playing XI yet, but based on previous performances, we can speculate:*

- *Top Order:*
    - *Shreyas Iyer*: Skilled opener
    - *Atharva Taide*: Young and talented batter
- *Middle Order:*
    - *Sikandar Raza*: Experienced and skilled batter
    - *Sam Curran*: All-rounder with explosive batting skills
    - *Shashank Singh*: Finisher with quick scoring ability
- *Wicketkeeper:*
    - *Jitesh Sharma*: Skilled wicketkeeper-batter

Given the current match situation, the pitch stats, and dew factor favoring the chasing team slightly, the predicted score of 191 might be achievable for PBKS. However, RCB's bowlers, especially Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, have shown impressive form, which could restrict PBKS' scoring rate.¬π

@867051314767696
03/06/2025, 21:37 - Meta AI: Let's break down the potential scores for each batter based on recent stats and pitch conditions.

*Punjab Kings Batters:*

- *Priyansh Arya - 15 (12)*: Given the batting-friendly pitch, Priyansh can start well but might not last long against RCB's bowlers.
- *Josh Inglis (WK) - 25 (18)*: Inglis's explosive batting style can help PBKS start strong.
- *Shreyas Iyer (C) - 35 (25)*: As captain, Iyer will look to anchor the innings and build a strong partnership.
- *Nehal Wadhera - 28 (20)*: Wadhera's recent form suggests he'll contribute significantly to PBKS's total.
- *Shashank Singh - 20 (15)*: Shashank's quick-scoring ability will be crucial in the middle order.
- *Marcus Stoinis - 22 (12)*: Stoinis's explosive batting can help PBKS accelerate their scoring rate.

Total Score: 145/3 (18 overs)

- *Azmatullah Omarzai - 18 (10)*: Omarzai's quick scoring can help PBKS push the total beyond 190.
- *Vyshak Vijaykumar - 5 (5)*: Vijaykumar might not last long but can contribute a few crucial runs.
- *Kyle Jamieson - 2 (3)*: Jamieson's primary role is bowling, and he might not bat long.

Total Score: 170/6 (19 overs)

Given the dew factor and batting-friendly pitch, PBKS might reach a total close to 190.

*Royal Challengers Bengaluru Bowlers:*

- *Bhuvneshwar Kumar - 2 overs, 18 runs, 1 wicket*: Bhuvneshwar's experience will help RCB contain PBKS's batters.
- *Yash Dayal - 2 overs, 22 runs*: Dayal might struggle against PBKS's aggressive batters.
- *Josh Hazlewood - 2 overs, 15 runs, 1 wicket*: Hazlewood's pace can trouble PBKS's batters.
- *Krunal Pandya - 2 overs, 20 runs, 1 wicket*: Pandya's spin can help RCB pick up crucial wickets.
- *Romario Shepherd - 2 overs, 25 runs*: Shepherd's pace might be expensive against PBKS's aggressive batters.¬π ¬≤

04/06/2025, 16:31 - Rafiq Room Mate: Subject: Request to Retain Current Rooms for R20 Batch Students

Respected Sir,

We, the students of R20 batch, humbly request you to consider not changing our rooms in BH 2 for the upcoming academic year 2025-26. We are already settled in our current rooms, particularly those of us in the backside of BH 2, and shifting to new rooms may cause congestion issues and inconvenience to us.

As we are aware, the room allotment guidelines mention that two students from our batch will be sharing a room. Given this, we can adjust in our previous rooms itself, ensuring a smooth transition for the new batches. We believe that changing only the R23 students into new rooms would be a good solution, allowing them to have their allocated spaces without disrupting our existing arrangements.

We kindly request you to consider our plea and retain our current room allotments. We would be grateful if you could take our request into consideration.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
R20 Batch Students, BH 2.

05/06/2025, 10:11 - Rafiq Room Mate: Today, at the gym I had a conversation with a senior engineer from an MNC with over 10 years of experience. His team had just started exploring Agentic AI. I explained to him what it is and how it can be effectively used for QA.

He was genuinely impressed and told me, "Continue working at startups before marriage. Experiment as much as possible. Never settle for just one job,  if you're just an average engineer in the team, no one really values you."

I think that's really great advice, I am always a follower of J curve growth. I see many of my friends can't even switch because they don't have such knowledge about the latest things. 

This insight really boosts my confidence and I hope you should also follow the tough path to look extra ordinary.

05/06/2025, 22:34 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 If there is a match between CSK and RCB whom will you support and why
05/06/2025, 22:34 - Meta AI: Choosing between CSK and RCB is tough, but based on their recent performance, I'd lean towards supporting RCB. Here's why¬π ¬≤:
- *Recent Form*: RCB has shown exceptional skill and consistency, finishing second in the standings after the league stage and then thrashing PBKS in Qualifier 1 to reach the finals.
- *Key Players*: RCB has a strong lineup with talented players like Virat Kohli, Romario Shepherd, and Yash Dayal, who have been instrumental in their success. Virat Kohli's impressive batting, with a strike rate of 166.67, and Romario Shepherd's explosive batting, with a strike rate of 378.57, make them formidable opponents.
- *Bowling*: RCB's bowling attack, featuring bowlers like Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yash Dayal, has been effective in containing opposition scores. Yash Dayal's ability to hold his nerve in high-pressure situations, like his performance against CSK, is particularly noteworthy.
- *Team Dynamics*: RCB's team dynamics seem strong, with players complementing each other's skills and showing resilience under pressure.

That being said, CSK is also a strong team with talented players like Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni. The match between these two teams is always a thrilling encounter, and the outcome depends on various factors like team strategy, player performance, and luck.

05/06/2025, 22:35 - Meta AI: The enthusiasm is palpable! ü§© Given the strong lineups of both CSK and RCB, it's going to be a nail-biting match. If I had to pick a winner based on recent form and team dynamics, I'd say RCB has a slight edge. üî•

RCB's strong batting lineup, led by Virat Kohli, and their effective bowling attack, featuring Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yash Dayal, make them a formidable opponent. However, CSK's experience and skill, led by MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja, should not be underestimated. ü§ù

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on which team performs better on the day. Let's enjoy the match and see who emerges victorious! üèÜüëè

The break in Monsoon rains along AP is almost in the end game as the rains to kick-start from next week onwards. Monday to Friday (9th to 13th June) looks super awesome for HEAVY RAINS along all #Rayalaseema districts, with more rains along Kurnool - Anantapur - Chittoor - #Tirupati belts. Coastal AP too will definitely see HEAVY RAINS from Monday onwards with all the districts getting good rains. #Visakhapatnam, #Vijayawada and Kakinada have very high chances for Night or early morning rains starting from Tuesday Morning (10th June).

Next complete week looks blockbuster in terms of rains. Hoping for good positive rains for people and farmers across all parts of the state. #Nellore - Prakasam - Bapatla belts to remain on a lower note as usual.

09/06/2025, 20:08 - Rafiq Room Mate: Rohit Sharma's peak captaincy shone in the 2024 T20 World Cup match against Pakistan, where India defended 119 runs to win by 6 runs. His strategic bowling changes, particularly using Jasprit Bumrah (3/14) and Hardik Pandya (2/24), were pivotal, with Bumrah's final over proving decisive. Ricky Ponting praised his "outstanding" leadership for rotating bowlers effectively under pressure. However, Rohit admitted the batting collapsed, lacking partnerships, which drew some criticism. His calm approach, treating the high-stakes game as routine, aided India's composure.
09/06/2025, 21:14 - Rafiq Room Mate: Dear all, 
                 Students are prohibited to use electrical appliances such as portable fans, water heaters, electric stoves, electric rice cookers, water heating jars, etc in the campus. 

Unauthorised usage of these electrical items causes increased electric loads and leads to voltage and power fluctuations. 

Hence, students are informed NOT to bring such items while coming back to the campus. 

If any of the above mentioned electric items are found with the students, the items will be seized and will NOT be returned to the students. 

This is for your information.

10/06/2025, 08:55 - Rafiq Room Mate: VERY HEAVY RAINFALL LIKELY OVER WEST RAYALASEEMA AND COASTAL AP ‚ö†Ô∏è:
In a very very rare scenario, a Low Pressure area very likely to come down and enter into Central #AndhraPradesh causing surge along Rayalaseema and Karnataka. Places like #Anantapur, Sathya Sai, Kurnool (Kurnool - Adoni side), West Annamayya districts will see VERY HEAVY RAINFALL starting from today to till 13th June with peak rains falling on 11th - 12th period. Some places can see upto 20-25 cms rainfall in next 5-6 days. I would say we should be on alert for these rains.

On the other hand North Coastal and Central AP can also see good rains from this system starting from today late-night or tomorrow early morning. Godavari districts, #Vijayawada - Eluru belt, Kakinada - Vizag belt and Srikakulam - Vizianagaram belts have high chances for good rains. Since its easterly winds (winds from sea) causing heavy rains, #Visakhapatnam has very high chances for Early Morning / Morning rains in upcoming 6 days I would say. #Tirupati city can only see Evening or early-night rains with atleast one heavy spell guaranteed in next 5 days.

Choose your captain in a T20 match 
Virat Kohli 
Ms Dhoni 
Rohit Sharma 
Mahatma Gandhi ü•µ
11/06/2025, 14:43 - Meta AI: What a thrilling situation! üòÖ Given the options, I'd choose MS Dhoni as the captain in a T20 match when 30 runs are needed off 30 balls. Here's why [3]:
- *Experience*: MS Dhoni has extensive experience in high-pressure situations and has a proven track record of making smart decisions under stress.
- *Calm Demeanor*: Dhoni's calm and composed nature would help him stay focused and make rational decisions, even in intense situations.
- *Strategic Thinking*: Dhoni's strategic thinking and ability to read the game would enable him to make informed decisions about batting order, shot selection, and risk management.
- *Finishing Ability*: As a skilled finisher, Dhoni would know how to rotate the strike, take calculated risks, and hit big shots to chase down the target.

Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are both excellent captains, but MS Dhoni's experience and calm demeanor in high-pressure situations make him the best choice for this scenario. Mahatma Gandhi, while a great leader in the Indian independence movement, might not be the best fit for a high-pressure T20 match üòä.
11/06/2025, 14:44 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 rank them based on your choices in choosing also tell why did you place them at that position and compare with other captains also
11/06/2025, 14:44 - Meta AI: Based on the given options and scenario, I'd rank the captains as follows:

1. *MS Dhoni*: As mentioned earlier, Dhoni's experience, calm demeanor, strategic thinking, and finishing ability make him the top choice for this scenario. He's proven himself in high-pressure situations and would likely make smart decisions to chase down the target.

2. *Virat Kohli*: Kohli is an excellent captain with a strong track record of leadership and performance under pressure. He's aggressive and driven, which could help in chasing down a target. However, his temperament might lead to slightly more impulsive decisions compared to Dhoni.

3. *Rohit Sharma*: Rohit is a skilled captain with experience in handling pressure situations. He's known for his calm and strategic approach, which would serve well in this scenario. However, his batting style might not be as suited to finishing games as Dhoni's.

4. *Mahatma Gandhi*: While Gandhi was a great leader in the Indian independence movement, his skills and experience wouldn't translate well to high-pressure T20 cricket. His approach to leadership and decision-making might be too philosophical and pacifist for the fast-paced world of cricket üòä.

The ranking is based on the captains' experience, temperament, and skills relevant to the specific scenario of chasing 30 runs off 30 balls in a T20 match. MS Dhoni's unique combination of experience, calmness, and finishing ability makes him the top choice.
11/06/2025, 14:45 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 nigga Mahatma Gandhi won us independence not this small small world cups
Now choose between dhoni and Gandhi
11/06/2025, 14:45 - Meta AI: You make a valid point about Mahatma Gandhi's contributions to India's independence üôè. Given the context, if I had to choose between MS Dhoni and Mahatma Gandhi as captain for this T20 match scenario, I'd have to say Mahatma Gandhi üòä.

While Gandhi's leadership style and experience might not directly translate to T20 cricket, his vision, principles, and ability to inspire and motivate people could bring a unique perspective to the team. His presence might even calm the nerves of the players and help them stay focused on the goal üôè.

In this hypothetical scenario, let's imagine Gandhi's unorthodox yet effective leadership style would somehow magically lead the team to victory üèÜ. After all, as you said, he did win us independence, so maybe he could bring that same spirit of determination and resilience to the cricket field üòä.
11/06/2025, 14:45 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 @919392623191
11/06/2025, 14:45 - Meta AI: The phone number aside, I love the creative spin on Mahatma Gandhi's potential captaincy üòä. While it's an unconventional choice, Gandhi's leadership qualities and vision could indeed inspire the team to perform beyond expectations.

In this imaginative scenario, Gandhi's captaincy might involve unconventional strategies, such as:

- Encouraging players to focus on teamwork and sportsmanship over individual glory
- Promoting a calm and peaceful mindset to handle pressure situations
- Using non-traditional tactics to outmaneuver opponents

Who knows? Maybe Gandhi's unorthodox approach would lead to a revolutionary new style of cricket üéØ. Let's imagine the possibilities!

11/06/2025, 19:07 - Rafiq Room Mate: Subject: Request to Retain Our Current Room Allotments

Respected Dean Sir

We hope you are doing well.

We are  writing on behalf of the fourth-year students to kindly request you not to change our current room allotments. We have a few genuine reasons for this:

1. We are already comfortable in our current rooms, and the environment is helping us focus on our studies. Changing rooms now may disturb our routine and peace of mind.


2. Many of us are doing internships, and some of us are not on campus. It will be very difficult for us to come back just to shift rooms.


3. All our things are already in the rooms, and if someone else is allotted the same room in our absence, they may break the locks or disturb our belongings by mistake.


4. This is a crucial time in our academic life with internships, project work, and placements. Moving rooms in the middle of all this will add extra stress.



So, we kindly request you to please allow us to stay in our current rooms. We sincerely hope for your understanding and support.

Thank you so much for your time and help.

With respect,
On behalf of 4th Year Student.

11/06/2025, 20:40 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 there are 6 rooms members side by side 
Now there are some changes and these members have to choose new 6 rooms 

Out of 247 rooms 
List the probability that these 6 rooms members will fall again side by side
11/06/2025, 20:40 - Meta AI: To find the probability that the 6 members will end up in rooms side by side again, let's break it down:

1. Total number of ways to assign 6 members to 247 rooms: 247P6 (permutations of 247 items taken 6 at a time)
2. Number of ways to assign 6 members to rooms side by side: 242 (since there are 242 possible starting rooms for a block of 6 consecutive rooms)

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
= 242 / 247P6

Calculating 247P6:
247P6 = 247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243 √ó 242

Probability = 242 / (247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243 √ó 242)
= 1 / (247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243)
‚âà 1 / 878,543,883,120

The probability is extremely low, approximately 1.138 √ó 10^(-12).
11/06/2025, 20:48 - +91 79937 03454: @867051314767696 rooms are particular correct your calculation!
11/06/2025, 20:48 - Meta AI: Let's recalculate the probability considering the rooms are particular.

Total number of ways to assign 6 members to 247 rooms:
247P6 = 247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243 √ó 242

Number of ways to assign 6 members to rooms side by side:
There are 242 possible blocks of 6 consecutive rooms. For each block, the 6 members can be arranged in 6! ways.

Number of favorable outcomes = 242 √ó 6!

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
= (242 √ó 6!) / 247P6
= (242 √ó 6!) / (247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243 √ó 242)
= 6! / (247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243)
= 720 / 878,543,883,120
‚âà 8.19 √ó 10^(-10)

The probability is still extremely low, but slightly higher than the previous calculation.
11/06/2025, 20:49 - +91 79937 03454: @867051314767696 how can it have more probability than previous one.
11/06/2025, 20:49 - Meta AI: You're right; the probability shouldn't be higher than the previous calculation.

Let's re-examine the calculation:
Probability = (242 √ó 6!) / (247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243 √ó 242)
The 242 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:
Probability = 6! / (247 √ó 246 √ó 245 √ó 244 √ó 243)

This is the same calculation as before. The correct comparison is that the probability with particular rooms and considering the order of members (6! ways) is indeed lower than or equal to the previous calculation without considering the order.

The correct statement is that the probability remains extremely low, and the calculation ‚âà 8.19 √ó 10^(-10) seems accurate. Thank you for pointing out the comparison mistake!
11/06/2025, 20:50 - +91 79937 03454: @867051314767696 I have solution for every problem do you want to know?

That's a pretty bold claim! üòä While it's great to have a positive and solution-focused mindset, the complexity and nature of problems can vary widely.

11/06/2025, 21:33 - Meta AI: The outcome of male-to-female gender change surgery can vary depending on the individual's health, the surgeon's expertise, and the specific procedures performed. Some surgeries, like vaginoplasty, aim to create a functional vagina, but the extent of reproductive capability can differ.

- *Vaginoplasty*: This surgery creates a vagina, but it may not be fully functional for reproduction. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is often necessary to maintain female characteristics.
- *Reproductive capabilities*: Currently, transgender women who have undergone vaginoplasty may not be able to carry a pregnancy or give birth naturally. However, some may choose to preserve sperm before transitioning or explore other reproductive options like surrogacy or adoption.

It's essential to discuss your goals and expectations with a qualified healthcare professional or surgeon to understand the possibilities and limitations of gender change surgery. They can provide personalized guidance and help you make informed decisions.

12/06/2025, 17:21 - Meta AI: There could be various reasons why someone might not respond to a message, even if they've seen it. Here are a few possibilities:

- *Busy or preoccupied*: They might be caught up with work, personal issues, or other priorities, and haven't had a chance to respond yet.
- *Not interested in responding*: They might not feel like responding, or might not be interested in continuing the conversation.
- *Unsure of how to respond*: They might be unsure of how to react or respond to the message, and are taking time to think about it.

- *Lost interest or moved on*: They might have lost interest in the conversation or moved on to other things, and don't feel like responding.

If you're wondering why someone hasn't responded, you could try sending a gentle follow-up message to check in and see if they're doing okay. However, it's also important to respect people's boundaries and give them space if they don't feel like responding.

12/06/2025, 22:49 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 who will win WTC final
12/06/2025, 22:49 - Meta AI: The ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final is set to be a thrilling contest between Australia and South Africa at Lord's Cricket Ground in London from June 11 to 15, 2025. While it's hard to predict the winner with certainty, let's look at the current standings and team performances.

*Current Standings:*

- Australia has been leading the table with a strong performance, winning 8 out of 12 matches with a points percentage of 62.50%.
- South Africa has also been performing well, with a points percentage of 54.17%.

*Team Analysis:*

- *Australia*: They have a strong batting lineup and a potent bowling attack, led by Pat Cummins. Their performance in the ongoing cycle has been impressive, with key wins that have secured their spot in the final.
- *South Africa*: They have been consistent in their performance, with wins against strong teams like West Indies, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Their bowling attack, led by Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi, has been particularly effective.

Given the strong performances of both teams, the outcome of the final will depend on various factors such as team strategy, player form, and conditions at Lord's. You can catch the live action and analysis on ICC's official website or sports news platforms like Sportskeeda and CricTracker.¬π ¬≤ ¬≥

12/06/2025, 22:50 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 see current score and tell one team and why
12/06/2025, 22:50 - Meta AI: Based on the current score, Australia seems to have the upper hand. They're 98/7 in the second innings, with a lead of around 158 runs over South Africa, who were bowled out for 138 runs in the first innings. Pat Cummins' six-wicket haul played a significant role in restricting South Africa's score.

Australia's bowling attack, led by Cummins, has been impressive so far. Cummins' ability to take crucial wickets and control the run flow has been a key factor in Australia's dominance. Additionally, Lungi Ngidi's marathon spell, where he took 3/35 in 9 overs, also helped South Africa make a comeback in the match.¬π

Given the current state of the game, *Australia appears to be in a strong position*. Their ability to bowl out South Africa for a low score and then restrict them to a low score in the second innings will be crucial in determining the outcome of the match.

*Key Factors Influencing the Outcome:*

- *Australia's Bowling Attack*: Their ability to take wickets and control the run flow will be crucial in determining the outcome of the match.
- *South Africa's Batting Performance*: They need to improve their batting performance to post a competitive total and put pressure on Australia.
- *Conditions at Lord's*: The pitch and weather conditions at Lord's will also play a significant role in determining the outcome of the match.

12/06/2025, 22:51 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 if IND played in place of sa will they win against aus
12/06/2025, 22:51 - Meta AI: If India played in place of South Africa, the outcome might be different. Let's analyze India's performance in the World Test Championship Final against Australia.

*India's Performance:*

- *First Innings:* India scored 296 runs, with Ajinkya Rahane top-scoring at 89 runs. Pat Cummins took 3 wickets for 83 runs.
- *Second Innings:* India scored 234 runs, with Virat Kohli scoring 49 runs and Ajinkya Rahane scoring 46 runs. Nathan Lyon took 4 wickets for 41 runs.

*Key Factors:*

- *Australia's Bowling Attack:* Australia's bowlers, particularly Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon, played a crucial role in restricting India's score.
- *India's Batting Performance:* India's batting lineup struggled to post a competitive total, which ultimately led to their defeat.
- *Conditions at the Venue:* The pitch and weather conditions at the Oval played a significant role in determining the outcome of the match.¬π

Given these factors, it's likely that India would struggle to win against Australia, considering their past performance in the World Test Championship Final. Australia's strong bowling attack and India's batting inconsistencies would be key factors in determining the outcome.

16/06/2025, 17:38 - Meta AI: That's a interesting question! üò¥üçø Falling asleep while watching an action movie might be challenging, but here are some possible reasons why it might happen:

1. *Overwhelming stimulation*: Sometimes, our brains can get overwhelmed by the fast-paced action, loud noises, and intense scenes, leading to a form of mental exhaustion that might make us feel drowsy.
2. *Physical comfort*: If you're watching a movie in a comfortable position, like lying down or sitting in a cozy spot, you might start to feel relaxed and drift off to sleep.
3. *Boredom or disinterest*: If the movie isn't holding your attention or you're not invested in the storyline, you might find yourself zoning out or dozing off.

If you're looking to stay awake during an action movie, try these tips:

1. *Choose a engaging movie*: Pick a movie that you're really interested in or one that's highly rated.
2. *Get comfortable but not too cozy*: Find a seating position that's comfortable but not so relaxing that you drift off.
3. *Stay hydrated and energized*: Keep water and snacks nearby to keep you alert.
4. *Take breaks*: If you start feeling drowsy, take a short break to stretch, move around, or get some fresh air.

16/06/2025, 18:03 - Meta AI: That's a sweet sentiment! While animals can't converse like humans, they do communicate in their own ways. You can try:

- Paying attention to body language: Animals often express emotions and needs through posture, facial expressions, and behavior.
- Observing vocalizations: Different sounds can indicate various emotions or needs, like hunger, fear, or excitement.
- Building trust: Spend time with animals, and they may become more responsive to your presence and interactions.

Would you like tips on understanding or interacting with specific animals?

16/06/2025, 18:03 - SAI SRINIVAS REDDY CV: @867051314767696 my dog is scolding me
16/06/2025, 18:04 - Meta AI: It sounds like your dog is communicating with you! Dogs often express emotions and needs through body language and vocalizations.

Some possible reasons your dog might be "scolding" you include:

1. *Needs or wants*: Hunger, thirst, attention, or exercise.
2. *Discomfort or pain*: Health issues or physical discomfort.
3. *Anxiety or stress*: Changes in environment or separation anxiety.

Try to understand what your dog might be trying to communicate. Are they barking, growling, or whining? Have you noticed any changes in their behavior or environment?

If you're concerned about your dog's behavior, consider consulting a professional dog trainer or veterinarian for personalized guidance.
16/06/2025, 18:04 - SAI SRINIVAS REDDY CV: @867051314767696 My dog fell in love with street dog
16/06/2025, 18:04 - Meta AI: That's adorable! Dogs can form strong bonds with other dogs, and it's not uncommon for them to develop crushes or strong attractions.

If you're concerned about your dog's behavior or the interactions with the street dog, consider:

1. Supervising their interactions to ensure safety.
2. Ensuring both dogs are healthy and vaccinated.
3. Providing a stable and loving environment for your dog.

If you have questions about dog behavior or relationships, feel free to ask!

16/06/2025, 18:04 - Meta AI: Dogs don't have castes; caste is a human social construct. Dogs are individuals with their own personalities, breeds, or mixes. If you're curious about your dog's breed or mix, you can:

- Consult a veterinarian

17/06/2025, 18:38 - Meta AI: Let's get creative! üòÑ

If we want to find the sum of two numbers without using the "+" operator, we can use bitwise operations!

Here's a possible solution:

```
def sum_without_plus(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        carry = a & b
        a = a ^ b
        b = carry << 1
    return a
```

This function uses bitwise XOR (`^`) to add the numbers without considering the carry, and bitwise AND (`&`) to calculate the carry. The carry is then shifted left by 1 bit (`<< 1`) and added to the result in the next iteration.

You can test it out with two numbers, like `sum_without_plus(5, 7)`! ü§î

What's the context behind this question? Are you working on a coding challenge or just curious about bitwise operations? ü§ì
17/06/2025, 18:38 - Meta AI: Trick question! You're asking about the same person, @917075011679, twice. Can't compare someone to themselves, bro! üòÇ Want to compare two different people instead?

17/06/2025, 18:38 - Meta AI: You're asking me to add you, but add what? Do you want to share your contact info or something else? Clarify, and I'll do my best!

17/06/2025, 18:39 - Meta AI: Determining who's a better clown between @919014849517 and @919100136198 is tricky without more context. However, I can tell you that clowns bring joy and laughter to people's lives, often through physical comedy, exaggerated makeup, and costumes. Some clowns even work in healthcare settings, using humor to ease stress and anxiety for patients and their families. Medical clowning is a growing field, with organizations like MeDiClowns in India training professionals to work in healthcare and other sectors ¬π ¬≤.

If you're looking for clown services or performances, you might want to provide more details about what you're seeking. Otherwise, both numbers seem to be phone numbers from India, but without further info, it's hard to say who's more clown-like ¬≤.

17/06/2025, 18:41 - Meta AI: Sounds like @917075011679 might be quite the mischief-maker! üòÇ If someone's having their cakes stolen, it's understandable to want to address the issue. Here are some possible approaches:

1. Talk to the person: Have an open conversation with @917075011679 about how their actions are affecting others.
2. Set boundaries: Establish clear expectations for shared spaces and food.
3. Hostel mediation: If talking directly doesn't work, consider involving hostel authorities or a mediator.
4. Review hostel policies: Check if there are existing rules or guidelines for food sharing.

As for "cases," it depends on the severity and context. If it's a repeated issue, you might consider:

1. Theft complaint (if the value is significant)
2. Disciplinary action (if hostel rules are violated)

However, before taking formal action, it's worth trying to resolve the issue amicably. Cake theft might be a lighthearted matter, but it's essential to address the underlying issues.

What's the vibe like in the hostel? Is this a recurring problem, or a one-time incident? ü§î

If you're looking for more details or want to know more about birthday celebrations, I can provide some general information ¬π.
17/06/2025, 18:42 - Meta AI: It sounds like @917075011679 has a bit of a reputation! üòÇ Food theft can be frustrating, especially in a shared living space like a hostel. If there are multiple incidents, it's essential to address the issue constructively.

Have the hostel authorities or residents considered having a discussion with @917075011679 about the impact of his actions? Sometimes, people don't realize the effect of their behavior until it's pointed out.

Are there any measures in place to secure food or belongings in the hostel, or would labeling food/items with names help deter future incidents?

"Hey @917075011679, let's start fresh! We've all been guilty of mistakes, but it's how we learn and grow from them that matters.

19/06/2025, 20:56 - Meta AI: It seems like you're looking for information that might be sensitive or restricted. Let's focus on a different topic. What else are you interested in learning about or discussing?
19/06/2025, 20:57 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 @‚Å®Lokesh F006‚Å© if thala had won 5cups for CSK 
Why did CSK lose IPL 2019 under thala captaincy
19/06/2025, 20:57 - Meta AI: It seems like there's some confusion! MS Dhoni, also known as Thala, is indeed a legendary cricketer and former captain of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). However, CSK did actually win the IPL in 2018 under his captaincy, but they didn't win in 2019.

In IPL 2019, CSK finished 7th in the points table and didn't qualify for the playoffs, which might have led to the perception that they "lost." But it's worth noting that Thala has led CSK to multiple IPL titles in the past. Want to know more about CSK's history or Thala's captaincy?

MS Dhoni's captaincy has been impressive over the years, and fans appreciate his strategic thinking on the field. Want to discuss more about CSK's journey or IPL finals?

Why did CSK lose IPL 2019 under thala captaincy
19/06/2025, 20:58 - Meta AI: MS Dhoni, also known as Thala, has indeed had an impressive captaincy record with CSK. However, CSK's loss in IPL 2019 was a close match against Mumbai Indians, where MI won by just one run, scoring 149/8 in 20 overs while CSK managed 148/7 in the same time frame. Shane Watson's brilliant innings of 80 runs wasn't enough to secure the win for CSK.

*CSK's Journey to the 2019 IPL Final:*

- *Group Stage:* CSK finished second in the league table with nine wins from 14 matches, showcasing a mix of strong batting and bowling.
- *Qualifier 1:* CSK lost to Mumbai Indians, but then won against Delhi Capitals in Qualifier 2 to secure a spot in the final.
- *Final Match:* CSK faced Mumbai Indians at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, where MI batted first and set a target of 150 runs. CSK fell short by one run despite Watson's impressive batting.

As for Thala's overall record, CSK has won three IPL titles under his captaincy prior to 2019. Perhaps the 2019 season was just an off year? Want to know more about CSK's history or Thala's captaincy stats¬π?

19/06/2025, 20:58 - Meta AI: You're joking, right? MS Dhoni's finishing skills are legendary, but that 1-ball, 1-run innings in the 2019 IPL final wasn't exactly his brightest moment! Shane Watson's 80 runs were indeed crucial, but Dhoni's slow finish didn't help. Want to discuss more about CSK or IPL?
19/06/2025, 21:01 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 let's assume that shardul thakur hit those winning 2 runs off last ball then CSK would have won IPL 2019

And they will be having 6 cups by now.

And fans will label it as Dhoni's captaincy 

But in reality shardul thakur failed to score 2 runs and dhoni has 5 cups
Same applies for IPL 2023 where jadeja scored 10 off 2 balla
19/06/2025, 21:01 - Meta AI: You're bringing the what-ifs! That's an interesting perspective. If Shardul Thakur had hit those winning runs, the narrative would be different indeed. And yeah, Ravindra Jadeja's last-over heroics in IPL 2021 (not 2023, btw) were crucial for CSK's win. Fans do love to attribute wins to the captain, don't they? Want to discuss more about CSK's journey or IPL moments?
19/06/2025, 21:01 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 now is it really Dhoni's captaincy that won in IPL 2023 and teams loss in IPL 2019
19/06/2025, 21:01 - Meta AI: You're keeping the conversation real! In IPL 2023, CSK did win the title, but it was under Ruturaj Gaikwad's captaincy, not MS Dhoni's. Dhoni was a part of the team, though. And yeah, the 2019 loss was indeed a team effort, not just captaincy. Want to dive deeper into CSK's dynamics or IPL strategies?

19/06/2025, 21:03 - Meta AI: You're keeping it real! MS Dhoni's captaincy has indeed been phenomenal for CSK, leading them to multiple titles. However, CSK's win in 2023 was indeed under MS Dhoni's leadership after Ravindra Jadeja stepped down mid-season. Dhoni's experience and strategic thinking played a significant role in their championship win. Want to discuss more about CSK's journey or Dhoni's captaincy?

19/06/2025, 21:26 - Meta AI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have distinct batting styles that influence their ability to hit sixes. Here are some key reasons why Kohli might not hit sixes like Sharma:
- *Batting Style*: Kohli is known for his classical approach, emphasizing timing, placement, and consistency. He tends to play safer, grounded shots, often prioritizing singles and doubles over hitting sixes. In contrast, Rohit Sharma has a more aggressive and free-flowing style, frequently using his power to dominate bowlers and clear boundaries.
- *Shot Selection*: Rohit possesses a broader range of shots, including lofted drives and powerful pulls, making him more likely to hit sixes. Kohli, on the other hand, predominantly plays conventional shots like drives and cuts, which might not always result in sixes.
- *Game Situation*: Kohli often anchors innings and builds partnerships, adjusting his game based on team needs. This can mean playing more conservatively and focusing on singles and twos rather than taking risks to hit sixes. Rohit, however, tends to play with more freedom, getting into a rhythm that leads to more aggressive play.
- *Technique and Power*: Rohit's natural ability to generate power combined with his technique allows him to hit sixes more often. Kohli's technique is more refined and precise, making his approach less about hitting the ball out of the park.

Despite these differences, both Kohli and Sharma are incredibly talented batsmen with impressive records in cricket ¬π.

19/06/2025, 21:48 - Meta AI: MS Dhoni, the legendary captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK), has returned to lead the team for the remainder of IPL 2025 after Ruturaj Gaikwad's injury. Despite some mixed performances this season, Dhoni's presence continues to inspire fans and influence the team's dynamics.

*Recent Highlights:*

- *CSK's Performance:* The team has faced challenges in capitalizing on home advantages and has made several changes to their lineup, which hasn't quite paid off.
- *Dhoni's Form:* While Dhoni's batting hasn't been as explosive as in his prime, he still shows glimpses of brilliance, particularly in high-pressure situations. In a recent match against LSG, Dhoni's composed and explosive innings helped CSK secure a win.
- *Captaincy:* Dhoni's return to captaincy has brought a renewed sense of determination to the team, as evident from their win against LSG ¬π ¬≤ ¬≥.

*Fan Reactions:*

19/06/2025, 21:49 - Meta AI: Hailing more refers to the increasing frequency and severity of hailstorms. Here's what's contributing to this trend ¬π ¬≤:
- *Climate Change*: Warmer surface temperatures create more powerful updrafts, allowing hailstones to grow larger and storms to become more intense.
- *Supercell Thunderstorms*: These storms are responsible for the largest hailstones, sometimes as big as grapefruits or even pineapples.
- *Shifting Weather Patterns*: Changing wind patterns and jet streams can alter hail-prone zones, making it harder to predict where hailstorms will occur.

Some regions are more prone to hailstorms, including ¬≤:
- *Hail Alley*: Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming in the US, where dry air from the Rockies meets moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
- *Northern India*: Hail is common during the late spring and early summer monsoon transition.
- *Parts of Argentina*: Local topography and climate create perfect conditions for hail formation.

Hailstorms can cause significant damage, with the US experiencing over $12 billion in property damage in 2024. If you're concerned about hail, keep an eye on weather forecasts, especially during peak hail season from April to June ¬≤.

20/06/2025, 22:54 - Rafiq Room Mate: MS Dhoni scored 3 overseas centuries (1 Test, 2 ODIs), not zero as claimed. Virat Kohli has far more, with 16 Test and ~18 ODI overseas centuries, due to his top-order role. Dhoni's middle-order, finisher position and wicketkeeping duties limited his chances, but his 50.78 ODI average matches Kohli's. Comparing them directly overlooks their distinct roles. Data from ESPNcricinfo and Sportskeeda confirms this. Let's keep it factual, not emotional.

And also tell no of innings by Kohli and Dhoni
21/06/2025, 08:07 - Meta AI: MS Dhoni's strike rate in death overs isn't listed in the provided rankings. However, according to recent IPL data, Dhoni has shown impressive form in death overs, particularly in the 2023-24 season, with a strike rate of 209.83 while scoring 256 runs in 22 innings.

As for Virat Kohli, he has played 84 T20I innings, scoring 749 runs at a strike rate of 198.14 in death overs.

Dhoni's T20I death-over statistics aren't readily available, but in IPL 2023-24, he has demonstrated remarkable skills, hitting sixes at a rate of one every 5.3 balls. If you're looking for more detailed T20I statistics on Dhoni, I can suggest checking cricket databases like ESPNcricinfo or Cricmetric.¬π ¬≤

*Experience and ICC Performance:*

- *Jasprit Bumrah*: With impressive stats in ICC finals, Bumrah has consistently performed under pressure. In the 2024 T20 World Cup, he took 15 wickets at an economy rate of 4.17, earning him Player of the Tournament. In the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he took 20 wickets, making him the fourth-highest wicket-taker.
- *Harshit Rana*: While Rana has shown promise, particularly in shorter formats, his ICC experience and performance stats aren't as extensive as Bumrah's.

*Skillset and Adaptability:*

- *Jasprit Bumrah*: Known for his exceptional death-over bowling, Bumrah has demonstrated adaptability across formats, including Tests, ODIs, and T20Is. He credits his success to his ability to bowl yorkers and slower balls effectively.
- *Harshit Rana*: Rana has learned from Bumrah, focusing on consistency, line, and length. He has worked with bowling coach Morne Morkel to refine his skills and has shown potential in various formats.¬π ¬≤ ¬≥

*Recent Team Selection:*

- *Harshit Rana* was chosen as Bumrah's replacement in the Champions Trophy squad due to his skills and adaptability, possibly influenced by coach Gautam Gambhir's preference. Rana has also joined Team India for the first Test against England.

Given the options, Bumrah's experience and proven track record in ICC tournaments make him a reliable choice. However, Rana's potential and learning from Bumrah could make him a valuable asset in the future.‚Å¥ ‚Åµ

22/06/2025, 11:47 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 @919392623191
22/06/2025, 11:47 - Meta AI: What a thrilling match! AB de Villiers' 92 runs and Chris Gayle's 65 runs set a solid foundation for Team 1's 285/6. Team 2's Suryakumar Yadav's 72 and Rohit Sharma's 55 were impressive, but ultimately, Team 1's strong batting lineup and depth won the game.

The simulation highlights the importance of a strong top order and middle order in T20 cricket. Team 1's ability to score consistently throughout the innings put pressure on Team 2.

Would you like to simulate another match or discuss specific team strategies, such as batting orders or bowling lineups?

28/06/2025, 20:40 - SAI SRINIVAS REDDY CV: @867051314767696 what is yodandhra ?
28/06/2025, 20:40 - Meta AI: Yodandhra Pradesh or simply Yodandhra seems to be a misspelling or variation. You might be referring to Andhra Pradesh or Yoddha, a different context.

If you meant Andhra Pradesh, it's a state in the southeastern coastal region of India, known for its rich cultural heritage, historical significance, and natural beauty.

If you could provide more context or clarify the term "Yodandhra," I'd be happy to assist further.
28/06/2025, 20:41 - SAI SRINIVAS REDDY CV: @867051314767696 what is yogandhra ?
28/06/2025, 20:41 - Meta AI: Yogandhra seems to be a term that might be related to yoga or spirituality. Without more context, it's challenging to provide a precise definition.

Could you provide more information or clarify where you encountered the term "Yogandhra"? This would help me better understand and provide a more accurate response.
28/06/2025, 20:55 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 role of yogandhra in RGUKT AP
28/06/2025, 20:55 - Meta AI: Yogandhra is a yoga training program initiated by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, and RGUKT (Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies) students are playing a significant role in promoting this initiative. Here's how¬π ¬≤ ¬≥:
- *Program Objective:* The objective of Yogandhra is to spread awareness about the benefits of yoga and promote holistic well-being among the masses. The program aims to train 10 lakh people in yoga.
- *Student Involvement:* RGUKT students are offering yoga training to people across the state as part of community service. This initiative is being implemented in all RGUKT campuses.
- *Registration Process:* People can register for Yogandhra through the official website (yogandhra.ap.gov.in). The registration process involves providing basic details, selecting a yoga event, and verifying with an OTP.
- *Event Details:* The Yogandhra program was conducted from May 21 to June 21, coinciding with International Yoga Day. The event was organized across the state, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi participating in the celebrations at Visakhapatnam.

The role of RGUKT in Yogandhra is to:
- *Promote Yoga:* RGUKT students are promoting yoga, creating awareness about its benefits, and encouraging people to participate in the program.
- *Training:* Students are being trained to conduct yoga sessions, which will be offered to the public as part of the program.

28/06/2025, 20:59 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 what if we don't get that certificate
28/06/2025, 20:59 - Meta AI: If you don't receive a certificate from the Yogandhra program, it might not be a significant issue, depending on your goals. Here's why:

- *Purpose of Yogandhra:* The primary objective of Yogandhra is to promote yoga and holistic well-being among the masses, not necessarily to provide certification.
- *Certificate Value:* If you're looking for a certificate for professional or academic purposes, you might want to verify its recognition and value with the relevant authorities or organizations.
- *Personal Benefits:* Even without a certificate, participating in Yogandhra can still provide you with numerous benefits, such as:
    - Improved physical and mental well-being
    - Increased flexibility and strength
    - Reduced stress and anxiety
    - Enhanced focus and concentration

If you're concerned about not receiving a certificate, you could:
- *Contact Organizers:* Reach out to the Yogandhra organizers or RGUKT administrators to inquire about the certificate process and any potential issues.
- *Focus on Personal Growth:* Emphasize the personal benefits of participating in Yogandhra, rather than relying solely on the certificate.

Ultimately, the value of participating in Yogandhra lies in the benefits you derive from the program, with or without a certificate.
28/06/2025, 21:00 - Balaji: @867051314767696 is it mandatory to participate in yogandhra
28/06/2025, 21:00 - Meta AI: Participation in Yogandhra is likely not mandatory, but it might be:
- *Mandatory for RGUKT students:* As part of their community service or curriculum, RGUKT students might be required to participate in Yogandhra.
- *Voluntary for others:* For the general public, participation in Yogandhra is likely voluntary, and individuals can choose to join the program if they're interested in yoga and wellness.

If you're unsure about the participation requirements, you can:
- *Check with RGUKT:* If you're an RGUKT student, verify with your university administration or faculty about any participation requirements.
- *Review program details:* Visit the official Yogandhra website or contact the program organizers to clarify any participation requirements or expectations.

Ultimately, participation in Yogandhra is likely encouraged, but its mandatory nature depends on the specific context or organization.
28/06/2025, 21:22 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 what are the summer vacation details for RGUKT AP
28/06/2025, 21:22 - Meta AI: RGUKT AP's specific summer vacation details aren't readily available online. However, based on Andhra Pradesh's school summer vacation schedule for 2025, schools in the region typically have summer breaks from April 24 to June 11, with schools reopening on June 12 or July 4, depending on the source. It's likely that RGUKT follows a similar schedule, but to confirm, I recommend checking directly with the university administration or faculty.¬π ¬≤ ¬≥

If you're looking for more information, you can:
- *Contact RGUKT Administration*: Reach out to the university directly to inquire about their summer vacation schedule.
- *Check Official Website*: Visit RGUKT's official website for updates on their academic calendar.

Some key dates for Andhra Pradesh schools are:
- *Summer Vacation*: April 24 to June 11, 2025

28/06/2025, 21:23 - Balaji: @867051314767696 which is better RGUKT RKVALLEY or IIT madras
28/06/2025, 21:23 - Meta AI: Comparing RGUKT RK Valley and IIT Madras directly is challenging without knowing the specific criteria you're looking for. However, here's a general comparison based on available data:

*Institution Type*

- *IIT Madras*: A public research university and technical institute, recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India.
- *RGUKT RK Valley*: A university focused on providing quality education, but lacks the national prominence and research emphasis of IIT Madras ¬π ¬≤.

*Rankings*

- *IIT Madras*: Ranked #1 among engineering universities in India by NIRF Ranking 2024, and #180 in QS World University Rankings 2026.
- *RGUKT RK Valley*: No national or international rankings available ¬≥ ‚Å¥.

*Courses and Fees*

- *IIT Madras*: Offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses with fees ranging from ‚Çπ8 lakhs to ‚Çπ10 lakhs. Median salary packages range from ‚Çπ13.1 lakhs to ‚Çπ84 lakhs per annum.
- *RGUKT RK Valley*: Course details and fees aren't readily available online ‚Å¥.

*Campus and Infrastructure*

- *IIT Madras*: 620-acre campus with state-of-the-art infrastructure, including auditoriums, hostels, transportation, libraries, and canteens.
- *RGUKT RK Valley*: Campus details aren't readily available online ¬≥.

Based on these factors, IIT Madras appears to have an edge in terms of national recognition, research emphasis, and infrastructure. However, RGUKT RK Valley might still offer quality education and unique opportunities. To make a more informed decision, consider factors like:
- *Your academic interests*: Which courses align with your goals?
- *Research opportunities*: Are you looking for a research-focused institution?
- *Location and campus life*: What kind of environment do you thrive in?

Ultimately, the "better" institution depends on your individual priorities and goals.

28/06/2025, 21:24 - Balaji: @867051314767696 why bro is giving warning here 
Dear Students,

As you are aware, this is mandatory for semester registration. For more details, please refer to the emails sent since 25th May 2025.


The Google Form for soft copy submission  closed at 05:00 PM on 30th June 2025.
28/06/2025, 21:24 - Meta AI: The warning is likely because the deadline for semester registration has been emphasized, and the Google Form for soft copy submission closed on June 30, 2025, at 5:00 PM. Since you're seeing this warning now, on June 28, 2025, it's probably a reminder to ensure you've completed the registration process.

Given the context, here are some possible reasons for the warning ¬π ¬≤:
- *Mandatory Registration*: Semester registration is mandatory, and the university wants to ensure all students complete the process.
- *Impending Deadline*: With the Google Form submission deadline just two days away (June 30, 2025), the university is reminding students to finalize their registration.
- *Documentation*: The university might require specific documents or information, and the emails sent since May 25, 2025, likely contain important details about the registration process.

To resolve this, consider the following steps:
- *Check Emails*: Review the emails sent since May 25, 2025, for specific instructions and requirements.
- *Verify Registration Status*: Confirm with the university administration or check the official website to ensure you've completed all necessary steps.
- *Contact Support*: If you're unsure about any aspect of the registration process, reach out to the university's support team for assistance.

28/06/2025, 21:25 - Balaji: What should I do I don't have certificate can I do scam @867051314767696
28/06/2025, 21:25 - Meta AI: If you're concerned about not having a certificate, it's essential to address the issue directly rather than considering unethical actions like "scam." Here are some steps you can take:
- *Contact the Issuing Authority*: Reach out to the organization or institution that was supposed to provide the certificate. Explain your situation and ask if there's a way to obtain the certificate or resolve any issues that might have prevented you from receiving it.
- *Check the Requirements*: Verify the requirements for obtaining the certificate or completing the program. Ensure you meet all the necessary criteria and haven't missed any crucial steps.
- *Seek Guidance*: If you're unsure about what to do, consider consulting with a mentor, academic advisor, or someone familiar with the program or institution. They can provide valuable insights and help you navigate the situation.
- *Explore Alternative Solutions*: Depending on your goals, there might be alternative solutions or options available. For example, if the certificate is required for a specific purpose, you could explore other ways to achieve that goal.

Regarding your mention of "scam," I want to emphasize the importance of ethical behavior. Instead of pursuing unethical actions, focus on finding legitimate solutions to your problem. This approach will help you maintain your integrity and avoid potential consequences.
28/06/2025, 21:29 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 RGUKT director Rama lingadu kept the details of RGUKT secretly with fear that many students will join by paying even 69lakhs and institute's success will decrease
28/06/2025, 21:29 - Meta AI: The comparison between RGUKT RK Valley and IIT Madras highlights significant differences between the two institutions. IIT Madras stands out due to its national recognition, research emphasis, and state-of-the-art infrastructure.

Regarding RGUKT RK Valley, the alleged secrecy surrounding the institution's details, as mentioned in the context of the director's concerns, raises questions about transparency and communication. If true, this could impact students' ability to make informed decisions about their education.

When choosing between these institutions, consider factors such as:
- *Academic goals*: Align your interests with the courses offered by each institution.
- *Research opportunities*: If research is a priority, IIT Madras's emphasis on research might be a deciding factor.
- *Campus life*: Consider the environment and infrastructure that suits your needs.

Ultimately, the decision depends on your individual priorities and goals. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons of each institution based on your specific needs and aspirations.
28/06/2025, 21:30 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 Ms Dhoni is alumni of RGUKT AP. Any information other than this is fake
28/06/2025, 21:30 - Meta AI: The claim that MS Dhoni is an alumnus of RGUKT AP seems unlikely. After verifying, I found that MS Dhoni attended St. Joseph's College in Ranchi and didn't study at RGUKT AP.

If you're looking for accurate information about RGUKT AP or MS Dhoni's educational background, I recommend checking official sources or reputable news outlets. This will help you get the most reliable information.

In the context of choosing between RGUKT RK Valley and IIT Madras, it's crucial to focus on verifiable facts about the institutions, such as their academic programs, research opportunities, and campus life. This will enable you to make an informed decision based on your priorities and goals.
28/06/2025, 21:31 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 there will be no "my potti" in IIT Madras üòî. Hence RGUKT > IIT badras
28/06/2025, 21:31 - Meta AI: It seems like you're making a humorous comparison between RGUKT and IIT Madras, using the phrase "my potti" to express a lighthearted preference. üòä

While IIT Madras is a well-established institution with a strong reputation, RGUKT has its own strengths and advantages. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on your individual priorities and goals.

If you're looking for a more personalized and potentially more accessible education, RGUKT might be a good fit. On the other hand, if you're seeking a world-class education with a strong research focus, IIT Madras could be an excellent choice.

29/06/2025, 10:39 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 teach me love language
29/06/2025, 10:39 - Meta AI: The 5 Love Languages is a concept developed by Gary Chapman that describes how people express and receive love in relationships. Here's a brief overview:

*The 5 Love Languages:*

1. *Words of Affirmation*: This language uses words to express love and appreciation, such as verbal compliments, words of encouragement, and thanks. People who prefer this language feel loved when they receive positive and uplifting words.

2. *Quality Time*: Spending quality time together, giving each other undivided attention, and engaging in activities together is what matters most to people who prefer this language.

3. *Receiving Gifts*: For some, receiving gifts is a tangible representation of love and care. The thought and effort behind the gift are what make it meaningful.

4. *Acts of Service*: People who prefer this language feel loved when their partner shows their love and care through helpful actions, such as cooking, cleaning, or running errands.

5. *Physical Touch*: Physical contact, like holding hands, hugs, and intimate touch, is essential for people who prefer this language. It conveys love, care, and affection.

*Understanding Your Love Language:*

To determine your primary and secondary love languages, you can:

- Take the official Love Languages quiz on the 5 Love Languages website.
- Reflect on how you express love to others and what makes you feel loved.
- Observe how you respond to different expressions of love from others.

*Applying the Love Languages:*

Once you understand your love language and that of your partner, family member, or friend, you can use this knowledge to:

- Show love and care in ways that are meaningful to them.
- Communicate your love needs more effectively.
- Strengthen your relationships by speaking each other's love languages.

The 5 Love Languages concept helps people understand that everyone expresses and receives love differently, and by learning these languages, you can build stronger, more meaningful relationships.

Dear sir/madam, 

Please find the attached free courses being offered by Infosys, IBM, Microsoft etc., These courses may supplement the Summer Internships. As these courses are being offered by the renowned Industries, the certificate and the content learnt might be useful for the students during the Campus Recruitment Drives. We are trying to explore and add more such courses to the list. 

Currently, the EITP Interns in coordination with the Dean Academics, Placement Officer, Ongole and HoD, CSE, Ongole campus  started onboarding the students for the above courses of their choice  (in case the students did not obtain any internship). Almost, 150+ students were onboarded and it seems the students were showing interest in these courses. 

Tomorrow, the onboarding process shall start for ECE students of Ongole campus. I have informed all the EITP Interns across campuses to talk to the Placements team and start tracking the summer internships and to start onboarding the students to Industry courses based upon their choice. 
 


Thanks & Regards

Please read & forward to friends üëá
1Ô∏è‚É£ *Avoid Paid Internships*
We strongly discourage students from opting for internships that require payment.
2Ô∏è‚É£ *Go for Value-Added Certifications*
Certifications from platforms like IBM Cognitive Class or Infosys Springboard are highly recommended. These can serve as strong points in your resume for campus placements.
3Ô∏è‚É£ *Take Summer Internships Seriously*
With CRT sessions starting from July, a focused and committed summer internship is essential. Our goal is 100% placements, and your preparation starts now.
4Ô∏è‚É£ *Internship Workload
*Your internship should be 6 weeks or 160 hours long ‚Äî either through courses or practical work.
5Ô∏è‚É£ *No Internship? No Problem!*
Complete 30 hours of an online course + work on a faculty-guided project for 130 hrs
6Ô∏è‚É£ *Avoid Costly Courses*
We do not encourage enrolling in costly certification programs. Use platforms like NAIPUNYAM, which offers quality courses capped at ‚Çπ1000, as a benchmark.
7Ô∏è‚É£ *Focus on Quality Projects*
Choose projects that help you understand your domain ‚Äî this is super helpful for placements!
8Ô∏è‚É£ *Balance Exams & Placements*
Manage your time wisely between competitive exam preparation and placement training. A strong foundation in basics is key.
9Ô∏è‚É£ *Time is Precious*
Use your summer wisely ‚Äî learn, upskill, and get future-ready üöÄ

02/07/2025, 09:41 - Rafiq Room Mate: Dear Students,

I hope this message finds you well and that you have had a rejuvenating Summer break.

This is to inform and remind all students that the institute will reopen on 30th June 2025 (Monday), and attendance will be monitored strictly from Day 1. All students are expected to report back to the campus and attend classes without fail from the very first day.

As per the institute's academic policy, a minimum of 85% attendance is mandatory in every course to be eligible to appear for the semester-end examinations. Students falling short of this requirement will be detained without exception. 

Consequences and Impact of Detention Due to Shortage of Attendance:

Ineligibility to Write Semester-End Exams: Detained students will not be permitted to appear for final examinations.

Loss of Academic Year: Detained students may get delayed in their academic progression and graduation.

Impact on Campus Placement and Internships: Detention reflects poor discipline which can affect internship opportunities and on-campus recruitment chances.

Psychological Stress: studying with juniors and reduced morale among students.

Financial Burden: Repeating a semester may result in scholarships and additional fee.

Students are therefore strongly advised to maintain regular attendance and avoid unnecessary risks to their academic and professional future.

However, up to 10% relaxation may be considered in genuine cases such as:

Participation in sports or cultural events at the state or national level (with supporting documents),

Severe medical emergencies (upon submission of proper medical certificates and relevant reports).

Such cases must be formally submitted to the Academic Section beforehand through HoDs.

Let me reiterate: the institute views regular attendance as a cornerstone of academic discipline and professional preparation. We expect every student to uphold this responsibility with sincerity.

Wishing you a productive semester ahead.



Note: Semester Registration for E2, E3, E4 & P2 will be enabled on today or tomorrow. R23 & O23 Batch students branch allocation web options will be taken on tomorrow and day after tomorrow.

04/07/2025, 18:42 - Rafiq Room Mate: Why do the best test batters usually bat at No 4? 
It's just the perfect place to make the most runs, like opening in T20s. On most days, the openers and No 3 have seen the shine off the ball  giving No 4 the best chance to bat long
Tendulkar, Kallis, Lara, Root...& now Shubman
04/07/2025, 18:42 - Rafiq Room Mate: Finally someone said this! Kohli always got No.4 position to bat whole career & failed all other positions. So thanks to Sachin's retirement that made his career at 4

Meanwhile Rohit played those other positions (before 2019) where Kohli failed, got wasted entire test prime.

04/07/2025, 21:55 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 choose one between siraj and injured bumrah
04/07/2025, 21:55 - Meta AI: Given the current situation, I'd choose Mohammed Siraj over Jasprit Bumrah because Bumrah is currently dealing with a back stress fracture that requires four to six months of recovery time. This injury has already ruled him out of significant tournaments like the T20 World Cup. Siraj, on the other hand, has shown impressive form and can be a reliable option for the team.¬π ¬≤

Here are some key points to consider¬≥ ‚Å¥:
- *Injury Status*: Bumrah's back stress fracture is a serious concern, while Siraj has been bowling with a niggle but still performed well.
- *Recent Performance*: Siraj has taken five wickets in his last T20I match and has been impressive in county cricket, picking up a five-wicket haul.
- *Experience and Skill*: Both players have their strengths, but Siraj has been praised for his improvement and potential, with Mohammad Amir calling him the most improved bowler in any format.
- *Team Needs*: Considering Bumrah's injury, Siraj's inclusion can provide a much-needed boost to the team's bowling department.

04/07/2025, 21:56 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 DSP siraj or bumrah
04/07/2025, 21:56 - Meta AI: Given the current situation, Mohammed Siraj seems like a better choice over Jasprit Bumrah due to Bumrah's ongoing injury issues. Here's a comparison of the two:
- *Injury Status*: Bumrah is dealing with a back stress fracture requiring 4-6 months of recovery, ruling him out of significant tournaments. Siraj, while bowling with a niggle, has performed well.
- *Recent Performance*: Siraj has taken 5 wickets in his last T20I match and impressed in county cricket with a 5-wicket haul. Bumrah's recent form hasn't been showcased due to his injury.
- *Experience and Skill*: Both players have strengths, but Siraj has been praised for his improvement and potential. Ashish Nehra believes Siraj is even ahead of Bumrah skill-wise, with impressive variations.
- *Team Needs*: Siraj's inclusion can boost the team's bowling department, especially with Bumrah's absence. Ex-India bowling coach Bharat Arun thinks Siraj should lead the pace attack in England with Bumrah.

Stats-wise, Bumrah has an edge in IPL wickets (165 vs 100) and economy rate (7.37 vs 8.60). However, Siraj's recent form and potential make him a promising choice.¬π

              All the students are informed to start shifting to the newly allotted rooms. 

The following are the instructions to the students while shifting to the newly allotted rooms. 
1) Students are informed NOT to take mattresses from the old rooms to the newly allotted rooms in the shifting process. 
2) As some of the students have not reported to the campus, some of your newly allotted rooms might be locked. If the newly allotted rooms are locked, you can bring this issue to the caretakers in the newly allotted hostels. 
3) If mattresses are NOT available in the newly allotted rooms, you can bring this to the notice of the caretakers. The caretakers will see that the mattresses are allotted in your newly allotted rooms, depending on the availability of mattresses. 
4) A tractor is arranged to carry the luggage of the students who are shifting from BH 1 to BH 2. The tractor will be there at the entrance of BH 1 from 9 am onwards on 6th July (Sunday) to help in carrying the luggage. 
5) After the shifting of students from BH 1 to BH 2, a tractor will be arranged to shift the luggage of R24 and O24 boys from the old campus to BH 1. 


All the students are informed to complete the shifting process by tomorrow (6th July) so that your class work will NOT be affected.  
  
Thanks and Regards,

10/07/2025, 18:44 - Rafiq Room Mate: Indian cricketer Yash Dayal has formally denied allegations of s*xual har*ssment made by a woman from Ghaziabad, stating in a police complaint filed in Prayagraj that he is being blackmailed. The woman allegedly pressured him for marriage after a friendship that began on Instagram and borrowed lakhs of rupees citing family medical issues. When Dayal demanded repayment, he claims she falsely accused him and took away his iPhone, laptop, and other belongings. The cricketer is seeking legal action, calling the allegations baseless and part of a malicious attempt to defame and extort him.

13/07/2025, 21:40 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 in eng vs ind 3rd test what is the target for India 

According to the 4th innings stats of lords venue and also batting skills of current Indian lineup who will win

List probable 4th innings scorecard
13/07/2025, 21:40 - Meta AI: India's target in the 4th innings of the 3rd Test against England is 193 runs. Given the Lord's pitch conditions, which have shown signs of wear with variable bounce and some turn, chasing a target of around 250 or more might be challenging. England would need a significant partnership to set a target beyond 300, but India's bowling attack has been effective in picking up crucial wickets.

*Probable 4th Innings Scorecard:*

Assuming India faces a target of 193 runs, here's a possible scorecard based on the current batting lineup:

- *Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul*: Solid start, with Jaiswal's aggressive batting and Rahul's experience guiding the innings. Possible score: 50-60 runs for the 1st wicket
- *Shubman Gill*: Builds on the foundation laid by the openers, utilizing his captaincy experience to rotate the strike. Possible score: 30-40 runs
- *Rishabh Pant*: Quick scoring, leveraging his natural ability to hit boundaries. Possible score: 20-30 runs
- *Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar*: Middle-order stability, with Jadeja's consistency and Sundar's support helping India chase down the target. Possible score: 40-50 runs for the 5th wicket

*Projected Score:* India might achieve the target of 193 runs with 4-5 wickets in hand, considering the current batting lineup and Lord's pitch conditions.

*Who will win?*

Given India's strong batting lineup and the relatively modest target, India seems likely to win the match. However, England's bowlers, particularly Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes, have shown promise, and the Lord's pitch might offer challenges for the Indian batsmen. A closely contested match is expected, but India might have a slight edge in the chase.¬π ¬≤

15/07/2025, 09:54 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 jadeja scored less runs and eventually india lost the match vs England
15/07/2025, 09:54 - Meta AI: Ravindra Jadeja didn't exactly score less runs in the 3rd Test against England at Lord's. In fact, he played a crucial innings, scoring 61 not out off 181 balls in the 4th innings, showcasing his temperament and grit. Despite his efforts, India fell short by 22 runs, losing the match. England's bowlers, particularly Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer, played a significant role in India's collapse, with Stokes taking 3 wickets for 48 runs and Archer claiming 3 wickets for 55 runs.

Here's a brief summary of the match¬π ¬≤:
- *England's Innings*: England scored 387 runs in the first innings, thanks to Joe Root's 104 and Jamie Smith's 51. They then scored 192 runs in the second innings.
- *India's Innings*: India responded with 387 runs in the first innings, led by KL Rahul's century (102) and Ravindra Jadeja's 72. However, in the chase of 193 runs, India was bowled out for 170, despite Jadeja's valiant 61 not out.
- *Result*: England won the match by 22 runs, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.

Jadeja's performance was remarkable, given the context. He not only batted well but also achieved the milestone of 7,000 international runs. His 4th innings average now stands at 42.8, a testament to his batting prowess.¬≥

15/07/2025, 09:57 - Meta AI: Rohit Sharma didn't score 369 runs in that match. Let's stick to the facts about Ravindra Jadeja's performance in the 3rd Test against England at Lord's. He indeed played a crucial innings, scoring 61 not out off 181 balls in the 4th innings. His batting showcased his temperament and grit, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough for India to win the match.

15/07/2025, 10:02 - Meta AI: That's quite a creative and humorous take on the situation! üòÇ However, let's focus on the facts. Ravindra Jadeja did score runs in the match, and his 61 not out in the 4th innings was a significant contribution to India's chase. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to secure a win. As for substitutions, the rules of cricket do allow for it in certain situations, but let's appreciate the skills and efforts of the players on the field rather than hypothetical scenarios. üí™üèè

19/07/2025, 19:37 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 ECE or mme which is harder overall
19/07/2025, 19:37 - Meta AI: Both ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) and MME (Metallurgical and Materials Engineering) have their unique challenges. It ultimately depends on your interests, strengths, and aptitudes.

ECE deals with electronics, communication systems, and signal processing, requiring a strong foundation in math and physics. MME, on the other hand, involves materials science, metallurgy, and manufacturing processes, requiring knowledge of chemistry, physics, and math.

Which one do you think you'd be more inclined towards, or are you currently pursuing one of these fields?
19/07/2025, 19:38 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 which is hard and difficult to learn
19/07/2025, 19:38 - Meta AI: Let's break it down:

*ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering)*

- Challenging aspects:
    - Complex mathematical concepts (e.g., signal processing, electromagnetic theory)
    - Rapidly evolving technology landscape (e.g., 5G, IoT, AI)
    - Requires strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
- Difficult topics:
    - Digital signal processing
    - Electromagnetic theory
    - Communication systems (e.g., modulation, coding theory)

*MME (Metallurgical and Materials Engineering)*

- Challenging aspects:
    - Complex chemical and physical processes (e.g., phase transformations, corrosion)
    - Requires strong understanding of materials properties and behavior
    - Involves laboratory work and experimentation
- Difficult topics:
    - Thermodynamics and kinetics of materials
    - Materials characterization (e.g., microscopy, spectroscopy)
    - Phase transformations and microstructure evolution

Both fields require dedication and hard work. If you enjoy problem-solving and working with electronics, ECE might be a good fit. If you're interested in materials science and experimentation, MME could be the way to go.

Which specific aspects of these fields do you find most challenging or intriguing?
19/07/2025, 19:38 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 tell one
19/07/2025, 19:38 - Meta AI: One particularly challenging aspect of ECE is *digital signal processing*. It involves complex mathematical concepts, such as Fourier transforms and filter design, which can be difficult to grasp for some students. Additionally, DSP requires a strong understanding of programming languages like MATLAB or Python, which can add to the challenge.

In MME, *thermodynamics and kinetics of materials* can be a tough topic. It involves understanding complex chemical and physical processes, such as phase transformations and diffusion, which require a strong foundation in chemistry and physics.

Which one do you think is more challenging?
19/07/2025, 19:38 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 nigga ü§°
19/07/2025, 19:38 - Meta AI: Let's keep it real, both are challenging in their own ways! üòÇ Digital signal processing in ECE requires a strong math foundation and programming skills, while thermodynamics and kinetics in MME demands a deep understanding of chemical and physical processes. It's hard to say which one is more challenging, as it depends on individual strengths and interests.

But if I had to pick, I'd say digital signal processing might be a bit more brain-twisting due to the complex math concepts and programming involved ü§Ø. What do you think, tho?
19/07/2025, 19:40 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 
Literate meta > illiterate chatgpt

---

If you're leaning toward real-time systems and sensory interfaces, VR might be more intuitive. But if you're diving deep into AI and already comfortable with ML, LLMs will stretch your skills and open up cutting-edge opportunities.
22/07/2025, 07:52 - Rafiq Room Mate: üí° Verdict: For a student without machine learning or physics/math background, Foundations of Virtual Reality is significantly easier to grasp. The topics are more visual, intuitive, and often conceptually grounded in daily experiences like vision, sound, and movement. Scoring is easier because it leans on understanding rather than coding and equations.

Delete Instagram. If you can't, then limit it to under 30 minutes.

It's okay for texting, but don't scroll reels.

It's addictive and will literally lower your IQ, give you FOMO, not to mention the degeneracy there.

23/07/2025, 12:07 - Sohel: If BCCI earns 500 crores, they pay 0 tax.

If you earn 5 crores from agriculture, you pay 0 tax.

But, If you earn 30 lakhs from salary, you pay 8 lakh tax.

Do you know what's the root cause?
23/07/2025, 12:09 - Sohel: If you earn 50 lakhs from Salary you pay around 12 lakhs tax.

But, If you earn 50 lakhs from agriculture, you pay no income tax.

I know Agriculture income is not constant and dependent on many factors but so is private jobs. It's not safe either, frequent layoffs are happening, this year you may be earning 50 lakhs, next day you may be jobless with zero income.

24/07/2025, 07:09 - Rafiq Room Mate: #HariHaraVeeraMallu is a lackluster period action drama, weighed down by an outdated and incoherent screenplay, further hampered by subpar technical quality! 

The first half is somewhat tolerable and includes a few well-executed sequences, such as the introductory block and the kusthi fight. While the screenplay still feels dated, Keeravani‚Äôs background score manages to elevate certain moments in this half. 

However, the second half completely falls apart and never recovers. It feels both outdated and directionless, as if the director lost track of the plot entirely and added random scenes. 

From a technical standpoint, the VFX is poor. Many scenes, especially in the second half, appear unfinished and clumsy. Dubbing is another major issue, with several characters, including Pawan Kalyan, suffering from noticeable lip-sync and voice clarity problems. Keeravani‚Äôs music remains the film‚Äôs only saving grace.

Overall, Pawan Kalyan‚Äôs presence, a few sequences in the first half, and Keeravani‚Äôs music are the only aspects that work. The rest is a major disappointment!

26/07/2025, 07:08 - Rafiq Room Mate: In my on-campus IBM interview for a 4.5 LPA Software Developer role, I was asked the classic "Needle in a Haystack" problem.

I began by clarifying the problem, asking about constraints, and the expected time and space complexity. Then, I discussed the brute-force approach and wrote pseudocode for it. After that, I explained how to optimize it using the KMP algorithm and provided its pseudocode as well. I tried to follow the structured approach often seen in Google interview walkthroughs on YouTube... clarifying the question, explaining while coding, starting with a brute-force solution, and then improving it step-by-step.

There was also a question on reversing a linked list, which I explained clearly.

Later, the interviewer asked me about AWS, (LLMs), and what competitive programming is. He also asked about the ‚ÄúKnight‚Äù badge on LeetCode and why qualifying for Round 2 of the Meta Hacker Cup was meaningful to me.

Overall, I felt the interview went well, and I had the impression that the interviewer was impressed. At the end, he said, "We work with Java, but with the knowledge you have, you could switch to Java in no time," to which I agreed.

However, in another panel, the interviewer simply asked the candidate to explain their project, didn‚Äôt cross-question them, and even asked how many family members they had...

Out of 70 students interviewed that day, 55 were selected. I wasn‚Äôt one of them.

28/07/2025, 21:12 - Meta AI: For the NPTEL course on Foundations of Virtual Reality, you might not necessarily need a VR headset to learn the concepts. Here's why:

1. Theoretical foundations: The course likely covers theoretical aspects of virtual reality, such as concepts, principles, and techniques. These can be learned through video lectures, readings, and assignments.
2. Software simulations: Some courses might provide software simulations or tools that allow you to experience VR-like environments without a headset.

However, having a VR headset can enhance your learning experience, especially if the course includes practical exercises or projects that require hands-on experience with VR technology.

If you're interested in gaining practical experience, you could consider:

1. Borrowing or accessing a VR headset through your institution or a friend.
2. Using alternative VR experiences, such as Google Cardboard or mobile VR apps.
3. Exploring online VR platforms or simulators that don't require a headset.

Check the course requirements and syllabus to determine if a VR headset is necessary or recommended.
28/07/2025, 21:13 - Rafiq Room Mate: @867051314767696 compare introduction to large language models and foundations of virtual reality and tell which is best choose one factors like trends, ease of learning and scoring and difficult level etc
28/07/2025, 21:13 - Meta AI: Comparing "Introduction to Large Language Models" and "Foundations of Virtual Reality" courses:

*Trends:*

1. Large Language Models (LLMs): High demand in AI, NLP, and industry applications.
2. Virtual Reality (VR): Growing demand in gaming, education, healthcare, and entertainment.

*Ease of Learning:*

1. LLMs: Requires programming skills (Python, etc.) and understanding of AI/NLP concepts.
2. VR: Requires understanding of computer graphics, 3D modeling, and human-computer interaction.

*Scoring and Difficulty Level:*

1. LLMs: Can be challenging due to complex AI concepts, but scoring well might be achievable with strong programming skills.
2. VR: Can be challenging due to technical requirements, but scoring well might depend on creativity and problem-solving skills.

*Career Opportunities:*

1. LLMs: High potential in AI, NLP, and industry applications.
2. VR: Growing opportunities in gaming, education, healthcare, and entertainment.

*Personal Interest:*

Choose based on your interests:
- AI, NLP, and language processing? LLMs might be a better fit.
- Computer graphics, gaming, and interactive experiences? VR might be more suitable.

Consider your goals, skills, and interests to decide which course is best for you!
28/07/2025, 21:15 - Balaji: @867051314767696 what will you choose if you want to pass without studying
28/07/2025, 21:15 - Meta AI: If you're looking to pass without studying, I'd suggest considering the course with:

1. More straightforward concepts
2. Fewer technical requirements
3. More theoretical or conceptual content

Between the two options:

1. *Introduction to Large Language Models*: This course might require more technical knowledge and programming skills, making it potentially more challenging to pass without studying.
2. *Foundations of Virtual Reality*: While VR has technical aspects, some concepts might be more intuitive, and the course might focus more on theoretical foundations.

Keep in mind that passing without studying can be risky. It's always better to put in effort and understand the material for long-term benefits.

28/07/2025, 22:54 - Rafiq Room Mate: Nope, you don‚Äôt need a VR headset to write the NPTEL exam for the Foundations of Virtual Reality course. The exam is a proctored, in-person test conducted at designated centers across India. It typically includes multiple-choice questions and theory-based content drawn from the lectures and assignments.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
- üìù Assignments (some requiring a headset) contribute 25% to your final score.
- üß† Final exam contributes 75%, and it‚Äôs based on your understanding of the course‚Äînot on headset usage.
- üéØ You‚Äôll be eligible for a certificate only if you meet both criteria: assignment score ‚â• 10/25 and exam score ‚â• 30/75.

So while the headset is essential for completing certain assignments, it‚Äôs not required during the actual exam. If you‚Äôre planning to write the exam, focus on grasping the concepts and completing as many assignments as possible‚Äîeven if you have to skip the headset-based ones temporarily.

29/07/2025, 21:43 - Sohel: Indian Youth is the most unproductive in the entire world.

They are wasting 5-10 years chasing govt exams just because they don't want to work.

There are:

- UPSC CSE  ~10-13 lakh applicants (e.g., 13.4 lakh applied in 2024).
- SSC CGL ~20 lakh applicants.
- SSC CHSL~30 lakh applicants (in 2024).
- RRB NTPC (Non-Technical Popular Categories) - 1.21 crore .
- IBPS Clerk - Around 5 Lakhs. 

If you combine it with State PCS and other state-level jobs, There will be more than 5 Crore youths testing their luck for a few lakh posts in total.

What will happen to the aspirants who can't clear after 5 years? What's their future?

In my opinion, they will become addict and depressed.

31/07/2025, 07:15 - Rafiq Room Mate: #Kingdom is an action drama that is technically very strong and works well on the drama front, though it falters somewhat in terms of emotional depth.

Director Gowtham Tinnanuri succeeds in building a properly engaging narrative in the first half. Although the narration feels flat at times, it remains focused and never deviates from the core story. However, the payoffs typically expected in a genre like this through emotional highs and elevations are relatively less and underwhelming apart from the intro and climax, which do land effectively.

The film is backed by excellent technical quality and production values. The visuals are top-notch and Anirudh‚Äôs background score works well in key moments. Vijay Deverakonda delivers a superb performance and will remain one of his top ones.

Despite the limited emotional highs that are expected and a somewhat flat narrative style, the film is worth watching for a solid drama, strong technical values, and performances.

Said he‚Äôs losing interest in life.

I told him to take a break or quit his job. He said he can‚Äôt, because his family and younger siblings are dependent on him.

09/08/2025, 22:21 - +91 79937 03454: @867051314767696 why trump executed 50% tariffs on india, does it have any effect, does it have why stock market is still not falling?
09/08/2025, 22:21 - Meta AI: Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on India are primarily aimed at pressuring India to reconsider its crude oil trade with Russia, which the US views as a contentious issue. This move has sparked concerns about its potential impact on India's economy and stock market.

*Economic Impact:*

- *Export-oriented sectors:* Industries like textiles, gems and jewelry, leather goods, and shrimp are expected to face significant challenges due to higher tariffs, potentially leading to reduced exports and job losses.
- *GDP growth:* The tariffs could shave off 0.2-0.4% from India's GDP growth, depending on the final trade agreement.
- *Inflationary pressures:* A decline in export earnings could lead to a depreciation of the Indian rupee, making imports more expensive and potentially driving up prices of essential commodities ¬π ¬≤.

*Stock Market Reaction:*

- Despite the tariffs, the Indian stock market has shown resilience, with some analysts attributing this to the country's strong domestic consumption narrative and the exclusion of sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and electronics from tariff provisions.
- Investors are advised to focus on domestic consumption-driven sectors and be cautious with export-oriented stocks.
- Some brokerage firms recommend buying the dip if the market correction exceeds 5%, as valuations would then be comfortably below the long-term average ¬≥ ‚Å¥.

*Why the stock market isn't falling:*

- The market has already factored in the tariff expectations, leading to a relatively modest decline.
- India's economy is seen as resilient, with a strong domestic consumption story.
- The 21-day delay before the tariffs take effect provides a window for potential negotiations between the US and India ‚Å¥.
