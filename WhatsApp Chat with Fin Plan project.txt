27/11/2025, 4:56 pm - Akshit Kibbs: Test on production
27/11/2025, 4:57 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: @⁨I am Charan⁩ When entering a goal (whether its retirement or education or wedding) with frequency set to yearly and can add the years, should be a integer number and not keep it as fixed. Also, if an option is added which says as “One Time”.
27/11/2025, 5:03 pm - I am Charan: <Media omitted>
27/11/2025, 5:04 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: •	All information should be linked with “Client Profile Sheet or interlinked with each other”. Example - Future sheet should pick values from Client Profile sheet.
27/11/2025, 5:58 pm - I am Charan: for this i have added the years field is it okay?
but adding this may leads to many subsequent changes
27/11/2025, 5:59 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Its frequency. Ideally user will add 1,2,3,4,5,6........
27/11/2025, 6:04 pm - I am Charan: <Media omitted>
27/11/2025, 6:08 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: @⁨Akshit Kibbs⁩ Let schedule a call tomorrow for atleast 1-2 hrs. Where you give a complete onboarding to me. And we go through each aspects. 

Please clearly note down:
1. How each sheet in excel is generated 
2. ⁠How each slide in PPT is generated
3. ⁠What is clearly not working as expected and 
4. ⁠What you think might not work

If possible please refactor code into smaller chunks. Make more files not an issue
27/11/2025, 6:13 pm - Akshit Kibbs: Sure
27/11/2025, 6:26 pm - I am Charan: <Media omitted>
27/11/2025, 6:28 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Yes
27/11/2025, 6:35 pm - I am Charan: With the current approach, using plan as a React state is causing several issues:

1)Each aspiration item would require its own plan state, which quickly becomes unmanageable and leads to a large number of states.

2)The backend does not return a plan field, so mapping the incoming data back to the UI becomes inconsistent and creates additional edge cases.

To avoid this complexity, I suggest we remove the separate plan field entirely and rely only on the existing frequency value.
The user can directly enter the frequency as 1, 2, 3, …, which keeps the data model clean, consistent, and easier to maintain across both frontend and backend.
27/11/2025, 6:40 pm - I am Charan: @⁨Akshit Kibbs⁩ @⁨Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai⁩  please help me solve this case
27/11/2025, 6:45 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: We will discuss more on this tomorrow
27/11/2025, 6:45 pm - I am Charan: okay
27/11/2025, 6:46 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Can you format the excel so that it looks more presentable?

27/11/2025, 6:46 pm - I am Charan: okay
27/11/2025, 6:46 pm - I am Charan: do i have to make the output of our excel  like this?
27/11/2025, 6:47 pm - Akshit Kibbs: No just formatting and styling
27/11/2025, 6:47 pm - I am Charan: okay i will see
27/11/2025, 6:48 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Yes just formatting and style to make sure its more readable and Good UI
27/11/2025, 6:48 pm - I am Charan: and its always showing 0 on production but working on local i want to debug and trouble shoot but how to access and see logs in the production
27/11/2025, 6:48 pm - Akshit Kibbs: I guess backend is not deployed yet with changes ??
27/11/2025, 6:49 pm - I am Charan: okay i will implement the suggestions which i said earlier

01/12/2025, 11:54 am - I am Charan: it will work as i am fetching data from the db

and here i am storing the IND , USD , EUR as a fallback so it should always have thosee fields even with no data in db
01/12/2025, 11:55 am - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Then why we created those fields in DB?
01/12/2025, 11:56 am - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: It should be fetched from DB only.
01/12/2025, 11:56 am - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: And no hardcoding
01/12/2025, 11:57 am - I am Charan: it is fully dynamic data only 

for cur in currencies:
            currency[cur.name.upper()] = {
                "deprication": deprications.get(cur.name.upper(), 0.0),
                "inflation": inflations.get(cur.name.upper(), 0.0),
                }

in this i am getting all currencies from db and showing in frontend
01/12/2025, 11:58 am - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Then remove this code
01/12/2025, 11:58 am - I am Charan: and you can see all the data which is directly coming from the data base

even you add a new currency then also it will work
01/12/2025, 11:59 am - I am Charan: okay i will remove 

but what i thought is, in case of db failure this will help without showing empty data
01/12/2025, 12:04 pm - I am Charan: https://github.com/KIPPS-AI/personal_financial_planner/pull/80/

i have commeted those lines and it is working

09/12/2025, 12:31 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Cool works
09/12/2025, 12:32 pm - I am Charan: one small suggestion :

after chnaing something do i have to generate excel again and again for every change 
or any simple thing to checkout wiithout downloading again
09/12/2025, 12:33 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Best will be to regenerate. But Once you have complete a table you test it by regenerating
09/12/2025, 12:34 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: after seeing the table RetirementVolatileAllocation has the same fields
09/12/2025, 12:35 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Can you rename RetirementVolatileAllocation to GlobalVolatilityComponent everywhere in code as well?
09/12/2025, 12:35 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Same for fields
09/12/2025, 12:36 pm - I am Charan: okay i will do 
do i  have to remove the RetirementVolatileAllocation  totally?
09/12/2025, 12:37 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Yes fields name is wrong
09/12/2025, 12:45 pm - I am Charan: some of the serialisers classes uses this name RetirementVolatileAllocationSerializer
09/12/2025, 12:45 pm - I am Charan: like this there will be many components using this name strucuture
09/12/2025, 12:46 pm - I am Charan: and GlobalVolatilityComponent is not using any where in the code so is it better to remove this component?
09/12/2025, 12:51 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: Bro naming is wrong you just need to replace the field and model name
09/12/2025, 12:51 pm - Nishit Sir Internship Kibbs Ai: I don’t think it should be a issue
09/12/2025, 12:51 pm - I am Charan: Okay
